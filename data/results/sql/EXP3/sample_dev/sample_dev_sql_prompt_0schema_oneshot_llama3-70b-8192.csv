Which payer paid for the medication Digoxin 0.125 MG Oral Tablet?,"Based on the question ""Which payer paid for the medication Digoxin 0.125 MG Oral Tablet?"", I will create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query.

To answer this question, we need to join two tables: `medications` and `payers`. The `medications` table likely contains information about medications, including their names, and the `payers` table contains information about the payers. We can assume that there is a third table, `payments`, that connects medications to payers.

To answer this question, we need to join the `medications` table with the `payers` table through the `payments` table, assuming the following table structure:

* `medications` table: `id`, `name`, `dosage`
* `payers` table: `id`, `name`
* `payments` table: `id`, `medication_id`, `payer_id`

Here's the correct SQL query:

[SQL]: 
SELECT DISTINCT p.name 
FROM medications m 
JOIN payments pm ON m.id = pm.medication_id 
JOIN payers p ON pm.payer_id = p.id 
WHERE m.name = 'Alendronic acid 10 MG Oral Tablet';

This query joins the `medications` table with the `payments` table on the `medication_id` column, and then joins the `payments` table with the `payers` table on the `payer_id` column. The `WHERE` clause filters the result to only include the payer for the specific medication 'Alendronic acid 10 MG Oral Tablet'. The `DISTINCT` keyword ensures that we get a unique payer name.",4.415457010269165

[Q]: 'In which city is the provider named Lynsey2 Lemke654 located?'

To answer this question, we need to query the `providers` table and the `cities` table, as the provider's location is likely stored in the `cities` table.

Let's assume the `providers` table has columns `id`, `name`, and `city_id`, and the `cities` table has columns `id` and `name`.

What is the total number of months being a member for the payer with ID d31fccc3-1767-390d-966a-22a5156f4219?,"Based on the question, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query.

[Q]: 'What is the total number of months being a member for the payer with ID d31fccc3-1767-390d-966a-22a5156f4219?'

[SQL]: 
SELECT SUM(duration_in_months) 
FROM memberships 
WHERE payer_id='d31fccc3-1767-390d-966a-22a5156f4219';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the total number of months being a member for a specific payer ID.
* We assume there's a `memberships` table with columns `payer_id` and `duration_in_months`.
* We use the `SUM` aggregation function to calculate the total number of months.
* We filter the results using the `WHERE` clause to only consider the payer with the specified ID.

What is the base cost of the immunization with code 133?,"Based on the question ""What is the base cost of the immunization with code 133?"", I will create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query.

Let's assume we have two tables: `immunizations` and `costs`. The `immunizations` table has columns `code` and `id`, and the `costs` table has columns `id` and `base_cost`. The `id` column in `immunizations` is a foreign key referencing the `id` column in `costs`.

Here's the correct query:

```
SELECT base_cost 
FROM immunizations 
JOIN costs ON immunizations.id = costs.id 
WHERE code = 133;
```

This query joins the `immunizations` and `costs` tables on the `id` column, and then selects the `base_cost` for the immunization with code 133.",5.159210920333862
Please provide me the patients treated with the procedure Colonoscopy.,"Based on the question, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query.

[Q]: 'Please provide me the patients treated with the procedure Colonoscopy.'

To answer this question, I'll assume there are two tables: `patients` and `procedures`. The `procedures` table has a foreign key `patient_id` that references the `id` column in the `patients` table.

[SQL]:
```sql
SELECT p.*
FROM patients p
JOIN procedures proc ON p.id = proc.patient_id

WHERE series.uid='1.2.840.99999999.1.30413319.1650275698924';

Here's the explanation:

* We need to find the body site code for a specific imaging study with a given series UID.
* The `imaging_studies` table likely contains the body site code, and the `series` table contains the series UID.
* We use a JOIN to connect the two tables based on the `study_uid` foreign key.
* We filter the results to only include the row with the specified series UID.
* We use `DISTINCT` to ensure we get a single, unique body site code.",5.234854221343994
