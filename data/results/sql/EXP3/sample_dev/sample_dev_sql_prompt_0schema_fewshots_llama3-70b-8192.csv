[Q]: Please provide me the number of medications uncovered by the payer Humana.

To answer this question, we need to count the number of medications that are not covered by the payer Humana. Assuming we have a `medications` table, a `payers` table, and a `coverage` table that links medications to payers, we can write the following query:

[SQL]: 
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT m.id) 
FROM medications m 
LEFT JOIN coverage c ON m.id = c.medication 
WHERE c.payer = 'Humana' AND c.covered = FALSE;

[Q]: What is the average quality of life score for customers under the payer with ID d18ef2e6-ef40-324c-be54-34a5ee865625?

To answer this question, we need to join the `patients` table with the `quality_of_life` table and filter by the `payer_id`. Assuming the `payer_id` is in the `patients` table, the query would be:

[SQL]: 
SELECT AVG(ql.score)
