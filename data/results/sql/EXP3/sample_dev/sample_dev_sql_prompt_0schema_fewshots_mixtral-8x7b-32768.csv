What is the successrate of medication Simvastatin 10 MG Oral Tablet?,"Based on the given note and examples, I'm assuming that the success rate of a medication is stored in the 'medications' table and is calculated as the ratio of the number of successful treatments to the total number of treatments with that medication.

This query will return the id of the imaging study with the given series UID. However, it does not return the date directly. The reason is that the date of an imaging study is not directly stored in the imaging\_studies table in the given examples. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a query that returns the date directly based on the given input.

If we assume that the date of an imaging study is stored in the encounters table and can be joined with the imaging\_studies table using the encounter\_id column, we can modify the query as follows:

SELECT e.date FROM imaging\_studies is LEFT JOIN encounters e ON is.encounter\_id = e.id WHERE is.series\_uid='1.2.840.99999999.1.93465008.1702305862410';

What is the successrate of medication NDA020800 0.3 ML Epinephrine 1 MG/ML Auto-Injector?,"To answer this question, we need to find the success rate of a specific medication, which is NDA020800 0.3 ML Epinephrine 1 MG/ML Auto-Injector. We can assume that there is a table called `medications` that contains the success rate of each medication. The table might look like this:

medications
----------
code (varchar)
success\_rate (numeric)

With this assumption, we can write the SQL query as follows:

```sql
SELECT success_rate 
FROM medications 
WHERE code = 'NDA020800 0.3 ML Epinephrine 1 MG/ML Auto-Injector';
```

This query will return the success rate of the medication NDA020800 0.3 ML Epinephrine 1 MG/ML Auto-Injector if it exists in the `medications` table. If the table or the structure is different, the query might need to be adjusted accordingly.",2.0883448123931885

When was the patient named Micah422 Buckridge80 born?,"SELECT p.first, p.last, p.birth FROM patients p WHERE CONCAT(p.first, ' ', p.last) = 'Micah422 Buckridge80';

Explanation:
The question asks for the birthdate of the patient with the name 'Micah422 Buckridge80'. However, the table 'patients' stores the first name in the 'first' column and the last name in the 'last' column. Therefore, we need to concatenate the 'first' and 'last' columns to match the name provided in the question. The 'birth' column in the 'patients' table stores the birthdate of the patient. Therefore, the query will select the 'first', 'last', and 'birth' columns from the 'patients' table where the concatenated 'first' and 'last' columns match the name provided in the question.",1.7641589641571045

What are the survival chances of allgery House dust mite (organism)?,"Based on the given question, it seems that there is no direct relationship between the ""allergies"" table and the survival chances. Therefore, it's not possible to provide an accurate SQL query without additional information.

However, if there is a table called ""survival_chances"" that has a foreign key related to the ""allergies"" table, we can create a query like this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT sc.survival_chance
FROM survival_chances sc
JOIN allergies a ON sc.allergy_id = a.id
WHERE a.description = 'House dust mite (organism)';
```

This query assumes that the ""survival_chances"" table has a column called ""survival_chance"" and a foreign key called ""allergy_id"" that relates to the ""allergies"" table. The query will return the survival chances for the allergy with the description 'House dust mite (organism)'.",5.851997375488281

Where was the patient named Qiana980 Okuneva707 born?,"Based on the given question, it seems that there is no direct relationship between the patients and their birthplace in the provided examples. However, assuming that there is a table called ""patients"" with columns ""first"" and ""last"" for the patient's first and last names, and a table called ""birthplaces"" with columns ""description"" and ""id"" for the description and id of the birthplace, we can assume that there is a relationship between these two tables through a foreign key.

Let's assume that the ""patients"" table has a column called ""birthplace"" that is a foreign key referencing the ""id"" column in the ""birthplaces"" table. With this assumption, we can write the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT b.description
FROM patients p
JOIN birthplaces b ON p.birthplace = b.id
WHERE p.first = 'Qiana980' AND p.last = 'Okuneva707';
```

This query will return the description of the birthplace of the patient named ""Qiana980 Okuneva707"".",1.5547263622283936
What is the most promising procedure for a patient with Mold (organism)?,"Based on the given question, it seems that we need to find the most promising procedure for a patient who has an allergy to Mold (organism). However, there is no direct relationship between the allergies and procedures tables. Therefore, we first need to find the encounters associated with the allergy Mold (organism), and then find the procedures associated with those encounters.

Here's the SQL query to find the most promising procedure for a patient with Mold (organism):
```vbnet
SELECT p.first, p.last, pr.description, pr.promising_level
FROM patients p
JOIN (
    SELECT DISTINCT e.id
    FROM encounters e
    JOIN allergies a ON e.id = a.encounter
    WHERE a.description = 'Mold (organism)'
) enc ON p.id = enc.id
JOIN procedures pr ON enc.id = pr.encounter
ORDER BY pr.promising_level DESC
LIMIT 1;
```
Explanation:

1. We start by selecting the first name and last name of the patient, the description, and the promising level of the procedure.
2. We join the patients table with a subquery that returns the encounter IDs associated with the allergy Mold (organism).
3. We join the encounters table with the allergies table to find the encounter IDs associated with the allergy.
4. We join the procedures table with the encounters table to find the procedures associated with the encounters.
5. We order the results by the promising level of the procedure in descending order.
6. We limit the results to 1 to get the most promising procedure.",1.9087445735931396
