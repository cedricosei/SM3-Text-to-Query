What is the successrate of medication NDA020800 0.3 ML Epinephrine 1 MG/ML Auto-Injector?,"To answer this question, we need to find the number of successful administrations and the total number of administrations for the medication NDA020800 0.3 ML Epinephrine 1 MG/ML Auto-Injector.

Here's the SQL query:
```vbnet

  (SUM(CASE WHEN result = 'Success' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*)) AS success_rate
FROM administrations a
JOIN medications med ON a.medication_id = med.id
WHERE med.name = 'NDA020800 0.3 ML Epinephrine 1 MG/ML Auto-Injector';

How many encounters are uncovered by the payer with the ID e03e23c9-4df1-3eb6-a62d-f70f02301496?,"To answer this question, we need to find the number of encounters that do not have a corresponding entry in the `payerclaims` table for the given payer ID. We can achieve this by using a LEFT JOIN and counting the number of NULL values in the `payerclaims` table.

Here's the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT e.id)
FROM encounters e
LEFT JOIN payerclaims pc ON e.id = pc.encounterid AND pc.payerid = 'e03e23c9-4df1-3eb6-a62d-f70f02301496'
WHERE pc.encounterid IS NULL;
```

This query first performs a LEFT JOIN between the `encounters` and `payerclaims` tables based on the encounter ID and the given payer ID. It then filters the results to only include encounters that do not have a corresponding entry in the `payerclaims` table (i.e., those with NULL `encounterid` values). Finally, it counts the number of distinct encounter IDs that meet these criteria.",2.0554544925689697
