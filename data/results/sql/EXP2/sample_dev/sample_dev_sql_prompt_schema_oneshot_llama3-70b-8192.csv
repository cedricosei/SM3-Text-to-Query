Who has received the immunization Influenza  seasonal  injectable  preservative free?,"Based on the provided schema, I'll help you create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'Who has received the immunization Influenza seasonal injectable preservative free?'

To answer this question, we need to join the `patients` table with the `immunizations` table, as the immunization information is stored in the `immunizations` table, and we need to filter the results to only include the specific immunization mentioned in the question.

[SQL]:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT p.first, p.last 
FROM immunizations i 
JOIN patients p ON i.patient = p.id 
WHERE i.description = 'Influenza seasonal injectable preservative free';
```
This query joins the `immunizations` table with the `patients` table on the `patient` column, and then filters the results to only include the patients who have received the specific immunization mentioned in the question. The `DISTINCT` keyword is used to remove duplicates, and the `SELECT` statement only retrieves the `first` and `last` names of the patients.",1.988478422164917
