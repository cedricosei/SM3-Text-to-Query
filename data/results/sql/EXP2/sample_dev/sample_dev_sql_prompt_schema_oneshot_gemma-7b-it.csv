JOIN allergies a ON e.id = a.encounter_id
WHERE a.code = '12345' -- House dust mite
GROUP BY e.id;
```

**Explanation:**

* The query joins the `encounters` table with the `patients` table on the `patient_id` column.
* It then joins the result with the `allergies` table on the `encounter_id` column.
* It filters the results to include only encounters with the `House dust mite` allergy (code `12345`).
* It counts the distinct number of patients in each encounter.
* It divides the count of distinct patients by the total count of encounters and multiplies by 100 to get the survival chances.
* The `GROUP BY` clause groups the results by the `encounter_id` to calculate the survival chances for each encounter separately.",3.804898738861084
