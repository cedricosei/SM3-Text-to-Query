[Q]: What is the total number of months being a member for the payer with ID d31fccc3-1767-390d-966a-22a5156f4219?

To answer this question, we need to query the `memberships` table, which likely has a foreign key referencing the `payers` table. Assuming the `memberships` table has columns `payerid` (foreign key referencing `payers.id`), `startdate`, and `enddate`, we can calculate the total number of months.

Who has been treated with the procedure of code 710841007?,"Based on the provided examples, I'll help create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query for the given question.

[Q]: 'Who has been treated with the procedure of code 710841007?'

To answer this question, we need to find the patients who have undergone a procedure with the code 710841007. We can achieve this by joining the `procedures` table with the `patients` table through the `claims` table.

[SQL]: 
```
SELECT DISTINCT p.first, p.last 
FROM procedures pr 
JOIN claims cl ON pr.claimid = cl.id 
JOIN patients p ON cl.patientid = p.id 
WHERE pr.code = '710841007';
```

This query joins the `procedures` table with the `claims` table on the `claimid` column, and then joins the `claims` table with the `patients` table on the `patientid` column. It then filters the results to only include patients who have undergone a procedure with the code 710841007.",13.214277982711792

To answer this question, we need to join the immunizations and encounters tables. Assuming the immunizations table has a column for the immunization name and a foreign key to the encounters table, we can write the query as follows:

[SQL]: SELECT e.id FROM immunizations i JOIN encounters e ON i.encounterid = e.id WHERE i.name='Influenza seasonal injectable preservative free';

This query joins the immunizations and encounters tables on the encounterid foreign key, and then selects the encounter id where the immunization name matches the specified string.",14.119051456451416
