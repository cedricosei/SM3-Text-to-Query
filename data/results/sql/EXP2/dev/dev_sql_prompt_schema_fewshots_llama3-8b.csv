            [Your Answer]:
            Please provide the SQL query for the given question. If the question cannot be answered with the given input, please respond with ""No answer possible based on given input"". 

            [Question]:
            Please provide me the patients with the claim ID 25382c93-4b35-d58c-d519-2f50343b3626.
            [Answer]:
            SELECT DISTINCT p.first, p.last FROM claims cl LEFT JOIN patients p ON cl.patientid= p.id WHERE cl.id='25382c93-4b35-d58c-d519-2f50343b3626'; 
            [Explanation]:
            The query uses a LEFT JOIN to combine the claims table with the patients table based on the patientid. The WHERE clause filters the results to only include the claim with the specified ID. The DISTINCT keyword is used to remove duplicate results. The first and last names of the patients are selected.

            [Your Answer]:
            Please provide the SQL query for the given question. If the question cannot be answered with the given input, please respond with ""No answer possible based on given input"". 

            [Question]:
            Please provide me the patients with the claim ID 25382c93-4b35-d58c-d519-2f50343b3626.
            [Answer]:
            SELECT DISTINCT p.first, p.last FROM claims cl LEFT JOIN patients p ON cl.patientid= p.id WHERE cl.id='25382c93-4b35-d58c-d519-2f50343b3626'; 
            [Explanation]:
            The query uses a LEFT JOIN to combine the claims table with the patients table based on the patientid. The WHERE clause filters the results to only include the claim with the specified ID. The DISTINCT keyword is used to remove duplicate results. The first and last names of the patients are selected.
