How many immunizations are uncovered by the payer with the ID 0133f751-9229-3cfd-815f-b6d4979bdd6a?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the given question.

[Q]: 'How many immunizations are uncovered by the payer with the ID 0133f751-9229-3cfd-815f-b6d4979bdd6a?'

To answer this question, we need to join the `claims` table with the `payers` table and the `immunizations` table. We'll use the foreign keys to establish the relationships between these tables.

Here's the correct SQL query:

[SQL]: 
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT i.id) 
FROM claims cl 
JOIN payers p ON cl.payerid = p.id 
JOIN immunizations i ON cl.id = i.claimid 
WHERE p.id = '0133f751-9229-3cfd-815f-b6d4979bdd6a' AND i.covered = FALSE;

This query joins the `claims` table with the `payers` table on the `payerid` foreign key, and then joins the result with the `immunizations` table on the `claimid` foreign key. It then filters the results to only include immunizations that are not covered (i.e., `covered = FALSE`) and belong to the payer with the specified ID. Finally, it counts the distinct number of immunizations that meet these conditions.",7.421793699264526
Please provide me the number of medications covered by the payer Anthem.,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'Please provide me the number of medications covered by the payer Anthem.'

To answer this question, we need to join the `payers` table with the `medications` table through the `payermedications` table, which is likely a bridge table connecting payers and medications.

[SQL]: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT m.id) 
FROM payers p 
JOIN payermedications pm ON p.id = pm.payerid 
JOIN medications m ON pm.medicationid = m.id 
WHERE p.name = 'Anthem';

This query joins the `payers` table with the `payermedications` table on the `payerid` foreign key, and then joins the `payermedications` table with the `medications` table on the `medicationid` foreign key. The `WHERE` clause filters the results to only include the payer 'Anthem'. Finally, the `COUNT(DISTINCT m.id)` function returns the number of unique medications covered by Anthem.",8.356679916381836
Please provide me the number of immunizations uncovered by the payer Humana.,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'Please provide me the number of immunizations uncovered by the payer Humana.'

To answer this question, we need to join the `claims` and `payers` tables, as the payer information is not directly available in the `claims` table. We also need to count the number of immunizations, which implies a `COUNT` aggregation function.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT cl.id) FROM claims cl LEFT JOIN payers p ON cl.payerid = p.id WHERE p.name='Humana' AND cl.type='immunization' AND cl.covered=false;

This query:

1. Joins the `claims` and `payers` tables on the `payerid` foreign key.
2. Filters the results to only include claims with the payer name 'Humana'.
3. Filters the results to only include claims of type 'immunization'.
4. Filters the results to only include claims that are not covered (i.e., uncovered).
5. Uses the `COUNT(DISTINCT cl.id)` aggregation function to count the number of unique immunization claims that meet the above conditions.

[Q]: 'Please provide me the encounters that were related to the supply with the code 704718009.'

To answer this question, we need to join the `supplies` table with the `encounters` table, as the supply code is mentioned in the `supplies` table, and we need to find the related encounters.

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT e.* FROM supplies s LEFT JOIN encounters e ON s.id = e.supplyid WHERE s.code='704718009';

Here's a brief explanation of the query:

* We select all columns (`*`) from the `encounters` table (`e`).
* We join the `supplies` table (`s`) with the `encounters` table (`e`) on the condition that the `id` column in `supplies` matches the `supplyid` column in `encounters`. This is because the foreign key `supplyid` in `encounters` references the primary key `id` in `supplies`.
* We filter the results to only include rows where the `code` column in `supplies` is equal to '704718009'.

Note that I used `LEFT JOIN` to ensure that we include all encounters related to the supply, even if there are no matching rows in the `supplies` table. If you want to only include encounters with a matching supply, you can use an `INNER JOIN` instead.",7.429600715637207

Which illness is most common in warmer climates?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll try to create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

However, I must point out that the question ""Which illness is most common in warmer climates?"" is quite vague and open-ended. It's not clear what specific tables or columns in the database are relevant to this question.

Assuming there are tables for ""illnesses"", ""climates"", and possibly ""regions"" or ""locations"" with climate information, I'll try to create a query. Please note that this is a rough attempt, and the actual query might need to be modified based on the actual database schema and available columns.

[SQL]: 
```
SELECT i.description, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM illnesses i
JOIN claims c ON i.id = c.illnessid
JOIN locations l ON c.locationid = l.id
JOIN climates cl ON l.climateid = cl.id
WHERE cl.type = 'warmer'
GROUP BY i.description
ORDER BY count DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

This query assumes the following:

* There's a table ""illnesses"" with a column ""description"" for the illness names.
* There's a table ""claims"" with a column ""illnessid"" that references the ""illnesses"" table.
* There's a table ""locations"" with a column ""climateid"" that references a ""climates"" table.
* There's a table ""climates"" with a column ""type"" that indicates the climate type (e.g., ""warmer"", ""cooler"", etc.).
* The query joins these tables to count the occurrences of each illness in warmer climates and returns the most common one.

Please note that this is a rough attempt, and the actual query might need to be modified based on the actual database schema and available columns. If more information about the database schema is provided, I can try to create a more accurate query.",7.346428632736206

JOIN claims c ON i.claimid = c.id 
JOIN payers p ON c.payerid = p.id 
WHERE p.name = 'Medicare' AND c.covered = FALSE;
```

Here's the explanation:

* We join the `immunizations` table with the `claims` table on the `claimid` foreign key.
* We join the `claims` table with the `payers` table on the `payerid` foreign key.
* We filter the results to only include immunizations where the payer is 'Medicare' and the claim is not covered (i.e., `covered = FALSE`).
* We use `COUNT(DISTINCT i.id)` to count the number of unique immunizations that meet the conditions.

Note: The assumption is that the `claims` table has a `covered` column that indicates whether the claim is covered or not. If this column does not exist, the query would need to be modified accordingly.",10.304533958435059

[Q]: 'What is the procedure code of the claim transaction 039d2cad-a241-ab5f-7046-d30342147e9d?'

To answer this question, we need to query the `claims` table, which likely has a foreign key to the `procedures` table. Assuming the `claims` table has a column `procedureid` that references the `id` column in the `procedures` table, we can use a JOIN to retrieve the procedure code.

[SQL]: SELECT p.code FROM claims cl LEFT JOIN procedures p ON cl.procedureid = p.id WHERE cl.id='039d2cad-a241-ab5f-7046-d30342147e9d';

This query joins the `claims` table with the `procedures` table on the `procedureid` foreign key, and then filters the results to only include the claim with the specified ID. The `SELECT` statement retrieves the `code` column from the `procedures` table, which corresponds to the procedure code of the claim transaction.",7.733846426010132

JOIN payers p ON m.payerid = p.id 
WHERE p.id = '734afbd6-4794-363b-9bc0-6a3981533ed5';

Here's a brief explanation of the query:

* We need to calculate the total number of months a member has been with the payer, so we use the `DATEDIFF` function to find the difference between the current date and the `membershipstart` date.
* Since we want the result in months, we divide the result by 30 (assuming a month has approximately 30 days).
* We join the `members` table with the `payers` table on the `payerid` foreign key to link the member to the corresponding payer.
* We filter the results to only include the payer with the specified ID using the `WHERE` clause.

Note: The assumption is that the `membershipstart` date is stored in the `members` table, and the `payerid` is a foreign key referencing the `id` column in the `payers` table. If the schema is different, the query may need to be adjusted accordingly.",8.411935567855835

What is the base cost of the immunization with code 62?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the given question.

[Q]: 'What is the base cost of the immunization with code 62?'

To answer this question, I'll assume that there are two tables involved: `immunizations` and `costs`. The `immunizations` table has a column `code` and is related to the `costs` table through a foreign key. The `costs` table has a column `basecost`.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT basecost FROM immunizations i JOIN costs c ON i.id = c.immunizationid WHERE i.code = 62;

This query joins the `immunizations` table with the `costs` table on the `id` column, filters the results to only include the immunization with code 62, and selects the `basecost` column from the `costs` table.",5.571923732757568

[Q]: 'Please provide me the reason for performing the procedure with code 430193006.'

To answer this question, I'll assume that there is a table called ""procedures"" with a column ""code"" and a column ""reason"", and possibly another table ""procedure_reasons"" with a column ""procedureid"" (foreign key referencing the ""id"" column in the ""procedures"" table) and a column ""reasondescription"".

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT pr.reasondescription FROM procedures p LEFT JOIN procedure_reasons pr ON p.id = pr.procedureid WHERE p.code='430193006';

This query joins the ""procedures"" table with the ""procedure_reasons"" table on the ""id"" and ""procedureid"" columns, respectively, and then filters the results to only include the row with the procedure code '430193006', finally selecting the ""reasondescription"" column.",6.157049179077148

Here's a brief explanation of the query:

* We need to count the number of unique customers, so we use `COUNT(DISTINCT c.customerid)`.
* We join the `customers` table with the `payers` table on the `payerid` foreign key.
* We filter the results to only include customers covered under the payer with the specified ID.

Note that I'm assuming the existence of a `customerid` column in the `customers` table and a `payerid` column in the `customers` table that references the `id` column in the `payers` table. If the actual column names or relationships differ, the query may need to be adjusted accordingly.",7.21213698387146

Which encounter is related to the allergy Allergy to substance (finding)?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the given question.

[Q]: 'Which encounter is related to the allergy Allergy to substance (finding)?'

To answer this question, we need to join the `allergies` table with the `encounters` table through the `encounter_allergies` table, which is likely a bridge table connecting encounters and allergies.

[SQL]: 
```
SELECT DISTINCT e.id 
FROM encounters e 
JOIN encounter_allergies ea ON e.id = ea.encounterid 
JOIN allergies a ON ea.allergyid = a.id

[Q]: 'What is the reason code for the procedure of code 180256009?'

To answer this question, we need to query the `procedures` table, which likely has a foreign key to the `reasons` table. Assuming the `procedures` table has a column `reasonid` that references the `id` column in the `reasons` table, we can write the following query:

[SQL]: SELECT r.code FROM procedures p JOIN reasons r ON p.reasonid = r.id WHERE p.code='180256009';

This query joins the `procedures` table with the `reasons` table on the `reasonid` foreign key, and then filters the results to only include the row where the `code` column in the `procedures` table matches the given value '180256009'. The `SELECT` statement only retrieves the `code` column from the `reasons` table, which is the desired output.",7.16203761100769

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT p.incomestatus FROM patients p WHERE p.first='Argelia29' AND p.last='Altenwerth646';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the income status of a specific patient, so we only need to query the `patients` table.
* We use the `WHERE` clause to filter the patient with the first name 'Argelia29' and last name 'Altenwerth646'.
* We use `SELECT DISTINCT` to retrieve the unique income status for the specified patient.

Note: If the patient's income status is not stored in the `patients` table, but rather in a separate table (e.g., `patient_demographics`), we would need to use a `JOIN` to retrieve the required information. However, based on the provided examples, it seems that the income status is stored in the `patients` table.",6.3091206550598145

To answer this question, we need to join the `immunizations` table with the `payers` table, as the payer information is not directly available in the `immunizations` table. We'll use the `payerid` foreign key to join these tables.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT i.id) FROM immunizations i LEFT JOIN payers p ON i.payerid = p.id WHERE p.name='Medicare' AND i.covered=false;

This query:

1. Joins the `immunizations` table with the `payers` table on the `payerid` foreign key.
2. Filters the results to only include immunizations where the payer is 'Medicare' and the `covered` column is `false`, indicating that the immunization is uncovered.
3. Uses the `COUNT(DISTINCT i.id)` aggregation function to count the number of unique immunizations that meet the conditions.

Note: If the `covered` column is not present in the `immunizations` table, the query would need to be adjusted accordingly.",7.33324122428894

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT recordeddate FROM patients p LEFT JOIN allergies a ON p.id=a.patientid WHERE a.description='House dust mite (organism)';

Here's a brief explanation of the query:

* We use a `LEFT JOIN` to combine the `patients` and `allergies` tables based on the foreign key `patientid`.
* We filter the results to only include the allergy record with the description 'House dust mite (organism)'.
* We select the `recordeddate` column, which is assumed to be the date when the allergy was recorded.

To answer this question, we need to query the `providers` table, which likely has a column for the provider's name and address. Since we're looking for a specific provider, we'll use the `WHERE` clause to filter by the provider's name.

[SQL]: SELECT address FROM providers WHERE name='Jacque955 Streich926';

This query assumes that the `providers` table has columns for `name` and `address`. If the address is stored in a separate table, such as `addresses`, we might need to use a `JOIN` to retrieve the address. However, based on the provided examples, it seems that the address is stored in the `providers` table.",7.131173849105835

FROM procedures p 
JOIN claims c ON p.claimid = c.id 
JOIN payers py ON c.payerid = py.id 
WHERE py.name = 'UnitedHealthcare' AND p.covered = FALSE;

Here's the explanation:

* We need to count the number of procedures that are not covered by the payer UnitedHealthcare.
* We join the `procedures` table with the `claims` table on the `claimid` foreign key.
* We then join the `claims` table with the `payers` table on the `payerid` foreign key.
* We filter the results to only include procedures where the payer is UnitedHealthcare and the procedure is not covered (`covered = FALSE`).
* We use `COUNT(DISTINCT p.id)` to count the number of unique procedures that meet the conditions.

Note: I assume that the `covered` column exists in the `procedures` table, which indicates whether a procedure is covered by the payer or not. If this column does not exist, the query would need to be modified accordingly.",7.360522031784058

[SQL]: SELECT birthplace FROM patients WHERE first='Isaac321' AND last='Rempel203';",6.556790351867676
How many new employees have been hired in the past month?,"To answer this question, we need to make some assumptions about the database schema. Let's assume there is a table called ""employees"" with columns ""id"", ""hiredate"", and possibly others.

Based on the question, we can write the following SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT id) FROM employees WHERE hiredate >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '1 month';

This query counts the number of distinct employee IDs (to avoid duplicates) where the hire date is within the past month. The CURRENT_DATE function returns the current date, and subtracting an interval of 1 month gives us the date range we're interested in.

Note: This query assumes that the ""hiredate"" column is of a date or timestamp type, and that the database is configured to use the correct date and time zone.",6.371176481246948

Here's the SQL query:

```
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT e.id)
FROM employees e
JOIN employment_history eh ON e.id = eh.employeeid
WHERE eh.event IN ('promotion', 'transfer');
```

This query joins the `employees` table with the `employment_history` table on the `employeeid` foreign key. It then counts the distinct number of employees who have either a 'promotion' or 'transfer' event in their employment history.",7.180886507034302

* We need to calculate the total number of months a member has been with the payer, so we use the `DATEDIFF` function to find the difference between the current date and the `membershipstart` date.
* Since we want the result in months, we divide the result by 30 (assuming a month has approximately 30 days).
* We use a `JOIN` to connect the `members` table with the `payers` table based on the `payerid` foreign key.
* We filter the results to only include the payer with the specified ID using the `WHERE` clause.

Note: The assumption is that the `membershipstart` column is in the `members` table, and the `id` column is in the `payers` table. If the column names or table structures are different, the query may need to be adjusted accordingly.",7.027109384536743

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT o.city FROM organizations o WHERE o.id='0a2252ba-33de-322f-8f0a-e5b0141f1780';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the city of the organization with a specific ID, so we only need to query the `organizations` table.
* We use the `WHERE` clause to filter the results based on the provided organization ID.
* Since we only need the city, we select only the `city` column.
* We use `DISTINCT` to ensure we get a unique result, even if there are multiple rows with the same city (although this is unlikely in this case).

[Q]: 'How many procedures are uncovered by the payer with the ID 0133f751-9229-3cfd-815f-b6d4979bdd6a?'

To answer this question, we need to join the `procedures` table with the `claims` table, and then filter the results based on the payer ID.

[SQL]: 
```
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT p.id) 
FROM procedures p 
LEFT JOIN claims c ON p.claimid = c.id 
WHERE c.payerid = '0133f751-9229-3cfd-815f-b6d4979bdd6a' AND c.covered = FALSE;
```

Here's a brief explanation of the query:

1. We join the `procedures` table with the `claims` table on the `claimid` column.
2. We filter the results to only include claims with the specified payer ID (`0133f751-9229-3cfd-815f-b6d4979bdd6a`).
3. We also filter the results to only include claims that are not covered (`covered = FALSE`).
4. Finally, we use the `COUNT(DISTINCT p.id)` aggregation function to count the number of unique procedures that meet the conditions.

Note that I assume the existence of a `covered` column in the `claims` table, which indicates whether the claim is covered or not. If this column does not exist, the query would need to be modified accordingly.",8.531968832015991

[Q]: 'Please provide me the udi code related to the device Home continuous positive airway pressure unit (physical object).'

To answer this question, I'll assume that there are two tables involved: `devices` and `udi_codes`. The `devices` table has a column `description` that matches the device description in the question, and the `udi_codes` table has a column `udi_code` that we want to retrieve. The two tables are connected through a foreign key `device_id` in the `udi_codes` table that references the `id` column in the `devices` table.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT uc.udi_code FROM devices d LEFT JOIN udi_codes uc ON d.id = uc.device_id WHERE d.description = 'Home continuous positive airway pressure unit (physical object)';

This query joins the `devices` table with the `udi_codes` table on the `device_id` foreign key, filters the results to only include the device with the specified description, and returns the distinct `udi_code` values associated with that device.",6.349747657775879

How many new employees have been hired in the past month?,"To answer this question, we need to make some assumptions about the database schema. Let's assume there is a table called ""employees"" with columns ""id"", ""hiredate"", and possibly others.

Based on the question, we can write the following SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT id) FROM employees WHERE hiredate >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '1 month';

This query counts the number of distinct employee IDs (to avoid duplicates) where the hire date is within the past month. The CURRENT_DATE function returns the current date, and subtracting an interval of 1 month gives us the date range we're interested in.

Note: This query assumes that the ""hiredate"" column is of a date or timestamp type, and that the database is configured to use the correct date and time zone.",7.388255834579468

[Q]: 'What is the most promising procedure for a patient with Animal dander (substance)?'

To answer this question, we need to find the most promising procedure for a patient with a specific allergy. We can achieve this by joining the `allergies` table with the `procedures` table through the `allergy_procedure` bridge table.

[SQL]: 
```
SELECT DISTINCT p.description 
FROM allergies a 
JOIN allergy_procedure ap ON a.id = ap.allergyid 
JOIN procedures p ON ap.procedureid = p.id 
WHERE a.description = 'Animal dander (substance)' 
ORDER BY p.efficacy DESC 
LIMIT 1;
```

Here's a brief explanation of the query:

1. We start by selecting the `description` column from the `procedures` table, which will give us the procedure name.
2. We join the `allergies` table with the `allergy_procedure` bridge table on the `allergyid` foreign key.
3. We then join the `allergy_procedure` table with the `procedures` table on the `procedureid` foreign key.
4. We filter the results to only include the allergy with the description 'Animal dander (substance)'.
5. We use the `ORDER BY` clause to sort the results by the `efficacy` column in descending order (highest efficacy first).
6. Finally, we use the `LIMIT 1` clause to return only the most promising procedure (i.e., the one with the highest efficacy).

Note that this query assumes the existence of an `allergy_procedure` bridge table, which is not explicitly mentioned in the examples. If this table does not exist, the query would need to be modified accordingly.",6.65352725982666

Which encounter is related to the allergy Mold (organism)?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question:

[Q]: 'Which encounter is related to the allergy Mold (organism)?'

To answer this question, we need to join the `allergies` table with the `encounters` table through the `encounter_allergies` table, which is likely a bridge table connecting encounters and allergies.

[SQL]: 
```
SELECT DISTINCT e.id 
FROM encounters e 
JOIN encounter_allergies ea ON e.id = ea.encounterid 
JOIN allergies a ON ea.allergyid = a.id 
WHERE a.description = 'Mold (organism)';
```

This query joins the `encounters` table with the `encounter_allergies` table on the `encounterid` column, and then joins the result with the `allergies` table on the `allergyid` column. The `WHERE` clause filters the results to only include encounters related to the allergy with the description 'Mold (organism)'. The `SELECT DISTINCT` statement ensures that we only get unique encounter IDs.",7.2727577686309814

How many unique customers does the payer Anthem have?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[SQL]: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT c.customerid) FROM payers p LEFT JOIN claims cl ON p.id = cl.payerid WHERE p.name='Anthem';

Here's a brief explanation of the query:

* We need to count the unique customers for the payer 'Anthem', so we use the `COUNT(DISTINCT)` function.
* We join the `payers` table with the `claims` table on the `payerid` foreign key to link the payer with the corresponding claims.
* We filter the results to only include the payer 'Anthem' using the `WHERE` clause.
* We use the `customerid` column from the `claims` table to count the unique customers.

Note: Assuming the `customerid` column is present in the `claims` table and the `name` column is present in the `payers` table. If the column names or table structures are different, the query may need to be adjusted accordingly.",6.493803977966309
Please provide me the number of procedures uncovered by the payer Dual Eligible.,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the given question.

[Q]: 'Please provide me the number of procedures uncovered by the payer Dual Eligible.'

To answer this question, we need to join the `procedures` table with the `payers` table, as the payer information is not directly available in the `procedures` table. We'll use the `payerid` foreign key to join these two tables.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT p.id) FROM procedures p LEFT JOIN payers py ON p.payerid = py.id WHERE py.name = 'Dual Eligible' AND p.covered = FALSE;

This query:

1. Joins the `procedures` table with the `payers` table on the `payerid` foreign key.
2. Filters the results to only include procedures where the payer is 'Dual Eligible'.
3. Filters the results to only include procedures that are not covered (i.e., `covered = FALSE`).
4. Uses the `COUNT(DISTINCT p.id)` aggregation function to count the number of unique procedures that meet the conditions.

Note: The assumption is that the `covered` column in the `procedures` table indicates whether a procedure is covered by the payer or not. If this assumption is incorrect, please provide more information about the schema and the columns involved.",7.796555995941162

Which illness is most common in warmer climates?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll try to create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

However, I must point out that the question ""Which illness is most common in warmer climates?"" is quite vague and open-ended. It's not clear what specific tables or columns in the database are relevant to this question.

Assuming there are tables for ""illnesses"", ""climates"", and possibly ""regions"" or ""locations"" with climate information, I'll try to create a query. Please note that this is a rough attempt, and the actual query might need to be modified based on the actual database schema and available columns.

[SQL]: 
```
SELECT i.description, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM illnesses i
JOIN claims c ON i.id = c.illnessid
JOIN locations l ON c.locationid = l.id
JOIN climates cl ON l.climateid = cl.id
WHERE cl.type = 'warmer'
GROUP BY i.description
ORDER BY count DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

This query assumes the following:

* There's a table ""illnesses"" with a column ""description"" for the illness names.
* There's a table ""claims"" with a column ""illnessid"" that references the ""illnesses"" table.
* There's a table ""locations"" with a column ""climateid"" that references a ""climates"" table.
* There's a table ""climates"" with a column ""type"" that indicates the climate type (e.g., ""warmer"", ""cooler"", etc.).
* The query joins these tables to count the occurrences of each illness in warmer climates and returns the most common one.

Please note that this is a rough attempt, and the actual query might need to be modified based on the actual database schema and available columns. If more information about the database schema is provided, I can try to create a more accurate query.",9.935967922210693

[Q]: 'What is the charge ID of the claim transaction cb36c3a0-bd16-5774-ff1d-8e3b467cd8a1?'

To answer this question, we need to query the `claimtransactions` table, which likely has a foreign key referencing the `claims` table. Assuming the `claimtransactions` table has a column `claimid` that references the `id` column in the `claims` table, we can write the following query:

[SQL]: SELECT chargeid FROM claimtransactions ct JOIN claims cl ON ct.claimid = cl.id WHERE cl.id='cb36c3a0-bd16-5774-ff1d-8e3b467cd8a1';

This query joins the `claimtransactions` table with the `claims` table on the `claimid` and `id` columns, respectively, and then filters the results to only include the row where the `id` column in the `claims` table matches the given claim transaction ID.

Please provide me the number of procedures uncovered by the payer Humana.,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the given question.

[Q]: 'Please provide me the number of procedures uncovered by the payer Humana.'

To answer this question, we need to join the `procedures` table with the `payers` table and the `claims` table. We'll use the foreign keys to establish the relationships between these tables.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT p.id) 
FROM procedures p 
JOIN claims c ON p.claimid = c.id 
JOIN payers py ON c.payerid = py.id 
WHERE py.name = 'Humana' AND c.covered = FALSE;

This query:

1. Joins the `procedures` table with the `claims` table on the `claimid` foreign key.
2. Joins the `claims` table with the `payers` table on the `payerid` foreign key.
3. Filters the results to only include claims where the payer is 'Humana' and the claim is not covered (`covered = FALSE`).
4. Counts the distinct number of procedures (`p.id`) that meet the filter criteria.

Note: The assumption is that the `claims` table has a `covered` column that indicates whether the claim is covered or not. If this column does not exist, the query would need to be modified accordingly.",7.433106184005737

How much revenue does the payer Anthem generate?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

Since the question asks about the revenue generated by the payer Anthem, I'll assume that there are tables for payers, claims, and possibly a junction table for payer-claim relationships. Let's create a query based on these assumptions.

[SQL]: SELECT SUM(amount) AS total_revenue FROM claims cl INNER JOIN payers p ON cl.payerid = p.id WHERE p.name = 'Anthem';

Here's a brief explanation of the query:

* We're selecting the sum of the `amount` column, which represents the revenue, and aliasing it as `total_revenue`.
* We're joining the `claims` table with the `payers` table on the `payerid` foreign key.
* We're filtering the results to only include claims associated with the payer 'Anthem' using the `WHERE` clause.

Note that this query assumes the existence of a `payerid` column in the `claims` table, which references the `id` column in the `payers` table. If the actual table structure is different, the query may need to be adjusted accordingly.",6.414129734039307

Here's a brief explanation of the query:

* We need to find the encounters related to the condition with code 283385000, so we start by selecting from the `conditions` table where `code` is '283385000'.
* Since we need to find the related encounters, we use a `LEFT JOIN` with the `encounters` table on the `conditionid` foreign key.
* We use `SELECT DISTINCT e.*` to retrieve all columns (`*`) from the `encounters` table, and `DISTINCT` to remove duplicates if any.
* The `WHERE` clause filters the results to only include conditions with the specified code.

Note that this query assumes the existence of a foreign key `conditionid` in the `encounters` table that references the `id` column in the `conditions` table. If this is not the case, the join condition might need to be adjusted accordingly.",7.803942441940308

To answer this question, we need to find the care plan with the code 384758001 and retrieve the date it was used. Since the question doesn't specify which table contains the usage date, I'll assume it's in the ""claims"" table, as it's a common table that might be related to care plans.

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT cl.date FROM claims cl LEFT JOIN careplans cp ON cl.careplanid = cp.id WHERE cp.code='384758001';

Here's the explanation:

* We use a LEFT JOIN to connect the ""claims"" table with the ""careplans"" table, using the foreign key ""careplanid"" in the ""claims"" table and the primary key ""id"" in the ""careplans"" table.
* We filter the results to only include the care plan with the code 384758001 using the WHERE clause.
* We select the ""date"" column from the ""claims"" table, which represents when the care plan was used.
* We use DISTINCT to remove any duplicate dates, in case the care plan was used multiple times.

Note: If the usage date is not in the ""claims"" table, the query might need to be adjusted based on the actual database schema and relationships between tables.",7.377070426940918

[Q]: 'What is the county of residence of the patient with the ID 7dc6cb76-a1bf-ba42-3d54-5c907b14d93a?'

To answer this question, we need to join the `patients` table with the `addresses` table, as the county of residence is likely stored in the `addresses` table.

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT a.county FROM patients p LEFT JOIN addresses a ON p.id = a.patientid WHERE p.id='7dc6cb76-a1bf-ba42-3d54-5c907b14d93a';

This query joins the `patients` table with the `addresses` table on the `patientid` foreign key, and then filters the results to only include the patient with the specified ID. The `DISTINCT` keyword is used to ensure that we only get one county of residence, even if the patient has multiple addresses.",8.827749252319336

[Q]: 'What is the diagnosis of the claim with the ID 1031ccb8-5d1f-7951-a60e-9984323a66c1?'

To answer this question, we need to join the `claims` table with the `diagnoses` table using the foreign key `claimid`. We'll select the `description` column from the `diagnoses` table, which represents the diagnosis.

Here's the correct SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT d.description FROM claims cl LEFT JOIN diagnoses d ON cl.id = d.claimid WHERE cl.id='1031ccb8-5d1f-7951-a60e-9984323a66c1';",6.720970392227173
Please provide me the number of medications uncovered by the payer Medicaid.,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the given question.

[Q]: 'Please provide me the number of medications uncovered by the payer Medicaid.'

To answer this question, we need to join the `medications` table with the `payers` table, as the payer information is not directly available in the `medications` table. We'll use the `payerid` foreign key to join these two tables.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT m.id) FROM medications m JOIN payers p ON m.payerid = p.id WHERE p.name='Medicaid' AND m.covered=false;

This query:

1. Joins the `medications` table with the `payers` table on the `payerid` foreign key.
2. Filters the results to only include medications where the payer is 'Medicaid' and the medication is not covered (i.e., `covered=false`).
3. Uses the `COUNT(DISTINCT m.id)` aggregation function to count the number of unique medications that meet the filter criteria.

Note: The assumption is that the `medications` table has a column `covered` indicating whether the medication is covered by the payer, and the `payers` table has a column `name` with the payer name. If the column names are different, please adjust the query accordingly.",7.495797157287598

* We'll use the `employees` table to get the `hoursworked` column.
* We'll use the `departments` table to filter employees by the IT department.
* We'll join the two tables using the `departmentid` foreign key.
* We'll use the `WHERE` clause to filter the department name as 'IT'.
* Finally, we'll use the `AVG` aggregation function to calculate the average number of hours worked per week.

Note: Assuming the `hoursworked` column is present in the `employees` table and the `name` column is present in the `departments` table. If the column names are different, please adjust the query accordingly.",8.187411308288574

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT e.* FROM conditions c LEFT JOIN encounters e ON c.encounterid = e.id WHERE c.code='840539006';

Here's a brief explanation of the query:

* We need to find the encounters related to the condition with code 840539006.
* The condition code is stored in the `conditions` table, and the encounter information is stored in the `encounters` table.
* We use a LEFT JOIN to combine the two tables based on the foreign key `encounterid` in the `conditions` table, which references the `id` column in the `encounters` table.
* We filter the results to only include conditions with the code 840539006 using the WHERE clause.

[SQL]: SELECT AVG(qualityoflife) 
FROM customers c 
JOIN claims cl ON c.id = cl.customerid 
JOIN payers p ON cl.payerid = p.id 
WHERE p.name = 'Blue Cross Blue Shield';

Here's a brief explanation of the query:

* We need to find the average quality of life score for customers under the payer name Blue Cross Blue Shield.
* We join the `customers` table with the `claims` table on the `customerid` foreign key.
* We then join the `claims` table with the `payers` table on the `payerid` foreign key.
* We filter the results to only include customers under the payer name 'Blue Cross Blue Shield'.
* Finally, we use the `AVG` aggregation function to calculate the average quality of life score.

Note: I assume that the `qualityoflife` column exists in the `customers` table. If it exists in a different table, the query would need to be adjusted accordingly.",6.438305139541626

[SQL]: SELECT SUM(amount) AS revenue FROM claims cl JOIN payers p ON cl.payerid = p.id WHERE p.name = 'Humana';

Here's the explanation:

* We need to find the revenue of the payer 'Humana', so we'll focus on the `claims` and `payers` tables.
* We'll use the `JOIN` statement to link the `claims` table with the `payers` table using the `payerid` foreign key.
* We'll filter the results to only include claims related to the payer 'Humana' using the `WHERE` clause.
* We'll use the `SUM` aggregation function to calculate the total revenue, and alias the result as 'revenue' for clarity.
* Since we're only interested in the revenue, we'll select only the `amount` column from the `claims` table.

Note: Assuming the `amount` column in the `claims` table represents the revenue, and the `name` column in the `payers` table stores the payer names. If the column names or relationships are different, the query may need to be adjusted accordingly.",7.6896443367004395

* We need to query the `imagingstudies` table to get the SOP description.
* Since the question mentions the series UID, we need to join the `series` table with the `imagingstudies` table using the foreign key `imagingstudyid`.
* We use the `LEFT JOIN` to ensure we get all results from the `imagingstudies` table, even if there's no matching series.
* We filter the results using the `WHERE` clause to only include the series with the specified UID.
* Finally, we use `SELECT DISTINCT` to remove any duplicate SOP descriptions.",7.948495388031006

What is the most promising procedure for a patient with Allergy to substance (finding)?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'What is the most promising procedure for a patient with Allergy to substance (finding)?'

To answer this question, we need to join the `allergies`, `patients`, and `procedures` tables. We'll assume that the `allergies` table has a foreign key `patientid` referencing the `id` column in the `patients` table, and the `procedures` table has a foreign key `patientid` referencing the `id` column in the `patients` table.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: 
```
SELECT DISTINCT p.description
FROM allergies a
JOIN patients p ON a.patientid = p.id
JOIN procedures pr ON p.id = pr.patientid
WHERE a.description = 'Allergy to substance (finding)'

```

This query:

1. Joins the `allergies`, `patients`, and `procedures` tables using their respective foreign keys.
2. Filters the results to only include patients with the allergy 'Allergy to substance (finding)'.
3. Orders the results by the `efficacy` column in descending order (assuming higher efficacy means more promising).
4. Limits the result to the top 1 most promising procedure.

Note: The assumption is that the `procedures` table has an `efficacy` column, which might not be the case. If the column is named differently or doesn't exist, the query would need to be adjusted accordingly.",7.629920482635498

Here's the explanation:

* We need to query the `imagingstudies` table to find the imaging study with the given ID.
* Since we want the modality description, we need to join the `modalities` table using the `modalityid` foreign key.
* We use `LEFT JOIN` to ensure we get the result even if there's no matching modality.

How many encounters are uncovered by the payer Anthem?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question:

[Q]: 'How many encounters are uncovered by the payer Anthem?'

To answer this question, we need to join the `encounters` table with the `payers` table using the `payerid` foreign key. We'll also use the `COUNT` aggregation function to count the number of encounters.

[SQL]: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT e.id) FROM encounters e LEFT JOIN payers p ON e.payerid = p.id WHERE p.name='Anthem';

Here's a brief explanation of the query:

* We join the `encounters` table with the `payers` table on the `payerid` foreign key.
* We filter the results to only include payers with the name 'Anthem'.
* We use the `COUNT(DISTINCT e.id)` aggregation function to count the number of unique encounters (in case there are duplicate encounter IDs).
* The `DISTINCT` keyword ensures we count each encounter only once.

Note that if the `payerid` column in the `encounters` table can be null (i.e., an encounter is not associated with a payer), the `LEFT JOIN` is used to include all encounters, even if they don't have a matching payer. If you want to only consider encounters with a payer, you can replace `LEFT JOIN` with `INNER JOIN`.",7.339717149734497

Which illness is most common in warmer climates?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll try to create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

However, I must point out that the question ""Which illness is most common in warmer climates?"" is quite vague and open-ended. It's not clear what specific tables or columns in the database are relevant to this question.

Assuming there are tables for ""illnesses"", ""climates"", and possibly ""regions"" or ""locations"" with climate information, I'll try to create a query. Please note that this is a rough attempt, and the actual query might need to be modified based on the actual database schema and available columns.

[SQL]: 
```
SELECT i.description, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM illnesses i
JOIN claims c ON i.id = c.illnessid
JOIN locations l ON c.locationid = l.id
JOIN climates cl ON l.climateid = cl.id
WHERE cl.type = 'warmer'
GROUP BY i.description
ORDER BY count DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

This query assumes the following:

* There's a table ""illnesses"" with a column ""description"" for the illness names.
* There's a table ""claims"" with a column ""illnessid"" that references the ""illnesses"" table.
* There's a table ""locations"" with a column ""climateid"" that references a ""climates"" table.
* There's a table ""climates"" with a column ""type"" that indicates the climate type (e.g., ""warmer"", ""cooler"", etc.).
* The query joins these tables to count the occurrences of each illness in warmer climates and returns the most common one.

Please note that this is a rough attempt, and the actual query might need to be modified based on the actual database schema and available columns. If more information about the database schema is provided, I can try to create a more accurate query.",6.642839431762695

To answer this question, we need to query the `allergies` table and the `allergy_records` table, as the recording date is likely stored in the `allergy_records` table.

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT ar.recorded FROM allergies a LEFT JOIN allergy_records ar ON a.id = ar.allergyid WHERE a.code='782576004';

This query joins the `allergies` table with the `allergy_records` table on the `id` column of `allergies` and the `allergyid` column of `allergy_records`, which is likely a foreign key. It then filters the results to only include the allergy with the code `782576004` and selects the `recorded` column, which contains the date the allergy was recorded.",8.767906188964844
What are the survival chances of allgery Aspirin?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

Since the question asks about the survival chances of an allergy, I'll assume that the survival chances are related to the allergy's severity. I'll join the `allergies` table with the `allergyseverities` table, which is not explicitly mentioned in the examples but is a reasonable assumption based on the context.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT asv.survivalchances FROM allergies a LEFT JOIN allergyseverities asv ON a.id = asv.allergyid WHERE a.description = 'Aspirin';

SELECT DISTINCT e.id 
FROM supplies s 
JOIN encounter_supplies es ON s.id = es.supplyid 
JOIN encounters e ON es.encounterid = e.id 
WHERE s.description = 'Blood glucose testing strips (physical object)';
```

This query joins the `supplies` table with the `encounter_supplies` table on the `supplyid` column, and then joins the result with the `encounters` table on the `encounterid` column. The `WHERE` clause filters the results to only include the supply with the description 'Blood glucose testing strips (physical object)'. The `SELECT DISTINCT` statement ensures that we get a unique encounter ID associated with the specified supply.",7.249337673187256

Please provide me the encounters that were related to the supply with the code 972002.,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the given question.

[Q]: 'Please provide me the encounters that were related to the supply with the code 972002.'

To answer this question, we need to join the `supplies` table with the `encounters` table, as there is no direct relationship between the `supplies` table and the `encounters` table. However, we can assume that there is an intermediate table, let's call it `encounter_supplies`, that connects `encounters` with `supplies`.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT e.id, e.date, e.description 
FROM encounter_supplies es 
JOIN encounters e ON es.encounterid = e.id 
JOIN supplies s ON es.supplyid = s.id 
WHERE s.code = '972002';

This query joins the `encounter_supplies` table with both the `encounters` and `supplies` tables, and then filters the results to only include encounters related to the supply with the code '972002'. The `SELECT` statement only retrieves the relevant columns from the `encounters` table.",7.237181901931763

[Q]: 'What is the reason for performing the procedure with the code 428211000124100?'

To answer this question, I'll assume that there are two tables: `procedures` and `reasons`. The `procedures` table has columns `code` and `reasonid`, and the `reasons` table has columns `id` and `reasondescription`. The `reasonid` in the `procedures` table is a foreign key referencing the `id` column in the `reasons` table.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT r.reasondescription FROM procedures p LEFT JOIN reasons r ON p.reasonid = r.id WHERE p.code='428211000124100';

Here's the explanation:

* We need to query the `imagingstudies` table to get the body site description for the specific imaging study with the given ID.
* Since the body site description is not directly available in the `imagingstudies` table, we need to join it with the `bodysites` table using the foreign key `bodysiteid`.
* We use a LEFT JOIN to ensure that we get the result even if there's no matching body site.
* We filter the result using the WHERE clause to only consider the imaging study with the given ID.
* Finally, we use SELECT DISTINCT to get the unique body site description for the specified imaging study.",7.291033983230591
How many employees have received promotions or transfers within the company?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the given question.

Since the question asks about employees who have received promotions or transfers, I'll assume there are two tables: `employees` and `employment_history`. The `employment_history` table likely contains information about promotions and transfers, and it's connected to the `employees` table through a foreign key.

Here's the SQL query:

```
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT e.id)
FROM employees e
JOIN employment_history eh ON e.id = eh.employeeid
WHERE eh.event IN ('promotion', 'transfer');
```

This query joins the `employees` table with the `employment_history` table on the `employeeid` foreign key. It then counts the distinct number of employees who have either a 'promotion' or 'transfer' event in their employment history.",8.026001930236816

Please provide me the number of immunizations uncovered by the payer Cigna Health.,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'Please provide me the number of immunizations uncovered by the payer Cigna Health.'

To answer this question, we need to join the `claims` table with the `payers` table and the `immunizations` table. We'll use the foreign keys to establish the relationships between the tables.

[SQL]: 
```
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT i.id) 
FROM claims cl 
JOIN payers p ON cl.payerid = p.id 
JOIN immunizations i ON cl.id = i.claimid 
WHERE p.name = 'Cigna Health' AND i.covered = FALSE;
```

Here's a brief explanation of the query:

1. We join the `claims` table with the `payers` table on the `payerid` foreign key.
2. We join the `claims` table with the `immunizations` table on the `claimid` foreign key.
3. We filter the results to only include claims with the payer 'Cigna Health' and immunizations that are not covered (i.e., `covered = FALSE`).
4. We use the `COUNT(DISTINCT i.id)` aggregation function to count the number of unique immunizations that meet the conditions.

Note: The assumption is that the `immunizations` table has a column `covered` that indicates whether the immunization is covered by the payer or not. If this column does not exist, the query would need to be modified accordingly.",7.446547508239746
Who has been treated with the procedure Depression screening using Patient Health Questionnaire Nine Item score (procedure)?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the given question.

[Q]: 'Who has been treated with the procedure Depression screening using Patient Health Questionnaire Nine Item score (procedure)?'

To answer this question, we need to find the patients who have undergone the procedure with the specified description. We'll use the `procedures` table to find the procedure ID and then join it with the `claims` table to get the patient IDs. Finally, we'll join the `claims` table with the `patients` table to get the patient names.

[SQL]: 
```
SELECT DISTINCT p.first, p.last 
FROM procedures pr 
JOIN claims cl ON pr.id = cl.procedureid 
JOIN patients p ON cl.patientid = p.id 
WHERE pr.description = 'Depression screening using Patient Health Questionnaire Nine Item score';
```

This query will return the first and last names of the patients who have undergone the specified procedure.",8.103971719741821
What is the encounter associated with the immunization Influenza  seasonal  injectable  preservative free?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the given question.

[Q]: 'What is the encounter associated with the immunization Influenza  seasonal  injectable  preservative free?'

To answer this question, we need to join the `immunizations` table with the `encounters` table using the `encounterid` foreign key.

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT e.id FROM immunizations i LEFT JOIN encounters e ON i.encounterid = e.id WHERE i.description = 'Influenza  seasonal  injectable  preservative free';

This query will return the distinct encounter IDs associated with the immunization 'Influenza  seasonal  injectable  preservative free'.",6.975136756896973
What is the state of residence of the patient named Oralia106 Lockman863?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'What is the state of residence of the patient named Oralia106 Lockman863?'

To answer this question, we need to join the `patients` table with the `addresses` table, as the state of residence is likely stored in the `addresses` table.

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT a.state FROM patients p LEFT JOIN addresses a ON p.id = a.patientid WHERE p.first = 'Oralia106' AND p.last = 'Lockman863';

Here's a brief explanation of the query:

* We select the `state` column from the `addresses` table (`a`).
* We join the `patients` table (`p`) with the `addresses` table (`a`) on the `patientid` foreign key.
* We filter the results to only include the patient with the first name 'Oralia106' and last name 'Lockman863' using the `WHERE` clause.
* We use `DISTINCT` to ensure we get a unique state value, in case there are multiple addresses for the same patient.",7.276130676269531
What type of observation is Heart rate?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question:

[Q]: 'What type of observation is Heart rate?'

To answer this question, we need to query the ""observations"" table, which is not explicitly mentioned in the examples. However, based on the context, I'll assume that there is an ""observations"" table with columns ""description"" and ""type"".

[SQL]: SELECT type FROM observations WHERE description='Heart rate';

This query will return the type of observation that corresponds to the description ""Heart rate"".",7.841740846633911

Which ethnicity does the patient with the ID 88c77778-4c35-0dbf-35cf-f58dbae35f0c have?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the given question.

[Q]: 'Which ethnicity does the patient with the ID 88c77778-4c35-0dbf-35cf-f58dbae35f0c have?'

To answer this question, we need to query the `patients` table, which likely has a column for `ethnicity`. Since we're looking for a specific patient with the ID `88c77778-4c35-0dbf-35cf-f58dbae35f0c`, we can use a `WHERE` clause to filter the results.

Here's the correct SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT ethnicity FROM patients WHERE id='88c77778-4c35-0dbf-35cf-f58dbae35f0c';",9.110490560531616
How long does Hydrochlorothiazide 25 MG Oral Tablet effect last?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'How long does Hydrochlorothiazide 25 MG Oral Tablet effect last?'

To answer this question, we need to find the duration of the medication effect, which is likely stored in the medications table. Since the question mentions a specific medication, Hydrochlorothiazide 25 MG Oral Tablet, we can use the description column to filter the results.

[SQL]: SELECT duration FROM medications WHERE description='Hydrochlorothiazide 25 MG Oral Tablet';

This query assumes that the medications table has a column named duration that stores the effect duration of each medication, and a column named description that stores the medication names. If the table structure is different, the query might need to be adjusted accordingly.",6.149250030517578
