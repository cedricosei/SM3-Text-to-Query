Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the SNOMED code of a specific encounter with ID 'a9b68dcd-50be-b3b0-e2eb-b718365e462d'.
* Since the question only mentions the encounter ID, we can directly query the `encounters` table.
* We only need to select the `snomed_code` column, as it's the only relevant information requested.
* We use the `WHERE` clause to filter the result to the specific encounter with the given ID.

Note that if the `encounters` table has a foreign key referencing another table, and the question required joining with that table, we would use a `JOIN` clause accordingly. However, in this case, the question only requires information from the `encounters` table.",6.12335729598999

Here's the explanation:

* We need to find the encounter where the care plan 'Care plan (record artifact)' was administered.
* We have two tables: `care_plans` and `encounters`.
* The `care_plans` table has a foreign key `encounterid` that references the `id` column in the `encounters` table.
* We use a JOIN to link these two tables based on the foreign key.
* We filter the results to only include the care plan with the specific name 'Care plan (record artifact)'.
* Finally, we select the `name` column from the `encounters` table, which represents the encounter where the care plan was administered.",5.319206237792969

Here's how I constructed the query:

1. I identified the relevant columns needed to answer the question: `allergy` from the `allergies` table.
2. I determined the tables involved: `patients`, `patient_allergies`, and `allergies`.
3. I used the foreign keys to establish the JOINs: `patientid` in `patient_allergies` references `id` in `patients`, and `allergyid` in `patient_allergies` references `id` in `allergies`.
4. I applied the filter conditions: `p.first='Zachery872' AND p.last='Hodkiewicz467'` to select the specific patient.
5. I used `DISTINCT` to remove duplicates, if any.

[Q]: 'Please provide me a list of patients associated with the payer with the ID 26aab0cd-6aba-3e1b-ac5b-05c8867e762c.'

To answer this question, we need to join the `patients` table with the `claims` table, and then join the `claims` table with the `payers` table, since the payer ID is associated with a claim, and a claim is associated with a patient.

Here's the correct SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT p.first, p.last 
FROM patients p 
LEFT JOIN claims cl ON p.id = cl.patientid 
LEFT JOIN payers py ON cl.payerid = py.id 
WHERE py.id = '26aab0cd-6aba-3e1b-ac5b-05c8867e762c';

This query will provide a list of patients associated with the payer having the ID '26aab0cd-6aba-3e1b-ac5b-05c8867e762c'.",6.172132730484009
Can you tell me when the observation Platelet distribution width [Entitic volume] in Blood by Automated count was recorded?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the given question.

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT o.observation_date 
FROM observations o 
JOIN observation_components oc ON o.id = oc.observation_id 
JOIN components c ON oc.component_id = c.id 
WHERE c.name = 'Platelet distribution width' AND c.unit = 'Entitic volume' AND o.specimen_type = 'Blood' AND o.method = 'Automated count';

Here's a brief explanation of the query:

* We start by selecting the `observation_date` column from the `observations` table, as that's what the question is asking for.
* We join the `observations` table with the `observation_components` table on the `observation_id` foreign key, as an observation can have multiple components.
* We then join the `observation_components` table with the `components` table on the `component_id` foreign key, as a component is part of an observation component.
* We filter the results using the `WHERE` clause to only include observations with the specified component name, unit, specimen type, and method.

Note that I'm assuming the existence of the following tables and columns:

* `observations`: `id`, `observation_date`, `specimen_type`, `method`
* `observation_components`: `observation_id`, `component_id`
* `components`: `id`, `name`, `unit`

If these assumptions are incorrect, please provide more information about the database schema, and I'll be happy to adjust the query accordingly.",6.3894102573394775

SELECT AVG(qol.score) 
FROM customers c 
JOIN payers p ON c.payerid = p.id 
JOIN quality_of_life qol ON c.id = qol.customerid 
WHERE p.name = 'Blue Cross Blue Shield';
```

Explanation:

* We need to find the average quality of life score for customers under the payer name 'Blue Cross Blue Shield'.
* We join the `customers` table with the `payers` table on the `payerid` foreign key to filter customers by payer name.
* We then join the `quality_of_life` table with the `customers` table on the `customerid` foreign key to access the quality of life scores.
* We use the `AVG` aggregation function to calculate the average quality of life score.
* We filter the results to only include customers under the payer name 'Blue Cross Blue Shield' using the `WHERE` clause.

Note: This query assumes that the `quality_of_life` table has a column named `score` that represents the quality of life score, and that the `payers` table has a column named `name` that represents the payer name. If the column names are different, the query will need to be adjusted accordingly.",6.706773519515991

FROM imaging_studies isop 
WHERE isop.id='f8773607-2f0e-50cb-bbd1-8578d805a218';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the SOP description of a specific imaging study with a given ID.
* Since the question only mentions the imaging study ID, we only need to query the `imaging_studies` table.
* We use the `SELECT DISTINCT` statement to retrieve the unique SOP description for the specified imaging study ID.
* We filter the results using the `WHERE` clause to only include the row with the matching ID.

Note: Assuming the `imaging_studies` table has a column named `sop_description` and an `id` column that matches the provided ID. If the column names are different, please adjust the query accordingly.",5.279358148574829

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT e.description 
FROM encounters e 
JOIN organizations o ON e.organizationid = o.id 
WHERE o.name='BRIGHAM & WOMENS HOSPITAL INC';

Here's the explanation:

* We need to query the `encounters` table to get the descriptions of the encounters.
* Since the question mentions the organization name, we need to join the `organizations` table with the `encounters` table using the `organizationid` foreign key.
* We filter the results to only include encounters linked with the specific organization 'BRIGHAM & WOMENS HOSPITAL INC' using the `WHERE` clause.
* We use `DISTINCT` to remove any duplicate descriptions, if any.

Note: Assuming the table and column names are correct, if the actual table and column names differ, the query would need to be adjusted accordingly.",5.041144371032715

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT isop.sop_description 
FROM imaging_studies isop 
WHERE isop.id='d3fa7d2e-1bca-65f1-74ae-d326343ab849';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the SOP description of a specific imaging study with a given ID.
* Since the question only mentions the imaging study ID, we can assume that the SOP description is a column in the imaging_studies table.
* We use the DISTINCT keyword to ensure we get a unique result, even if there are multiple rows with the same SOP description.
* We filter the results using the WHERE clause to only include the row with the specified ID.

Note: If the SOP description is not a column in the imaging_studies table, but rather in a related table, we would need to use a JOIN to retrieve the required information. However, based on the provided question, it seems that the SOP description is a column in the imaging_studies table.",4.257387161254883

[Q]: 'Please provide me the patients associated with the supply named Isolation gown single-use (physical object).'

To answer this question, we need to join the `patients`, `claims`, and `supplies` tables. We'll assume the following table structure:

* `patients` table: `id`, `first`, `last`
* `claims` table: `id`, `patientid`, `supplyid`
* `supplies` table: `id`, `name`

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT p.city FROM providers p WHERE p.id='b22221d1-1d72-3390-a434-a8efd1cb2d3e';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the city of the provider with a specific ID, so we only need to query the `providers` table.
* We use the `WHERE` clause to filter the results based on the provider ID mentioned in the question.
* Since we only need the city, we select only the `city` column from the `providers` table.

Note: Assuming the `providers` table has an `id` column and a `city` column. If the table structure is different, the query might need to be adjusted accordingly.",4.977433204650879
Please provide me the encounters that are related to the device with code 91537007.,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT e.* 
FROM devices d 
JOIN encounters e ON d.id = e.deviceid 
WHERE d.code = '91537007';

Here's a brief explanation of the query:

* We start by selecting all columns (`*`) from the `encounters` table, which is aliased as `e`.
* We join the `devices` table, aliased as `d`, with the `encounters` table on the condition that the `id` column in `devices` matches the `deviceid` column in `encounters`. This is based on the assumption that there is a foreign key relationship between the two tables.
* We filter the results to only include encounters related to the device with the code `91537007` using the `WHERE` clause.

Note that I'm assuming the existence of a foreign key relationship between the `devices` and `encounters` tables, and that the `deviceid` column in `encounters` references the `id` column in `devices`. If this is not the case, the query may need to be adjusted accordingly.",5.533798456192017

In this query, we're selecting the 'county' column from the 'patients' table where the 'id' column matches the provided patient ID. Since we're only interested in the county of residence, we only need to query the 'patients' table.",5.920405149459839
When did the allergy described as Animal dander (substance) stop?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'When did the allergy described as Animal dander (substance) stop?'

To answer this question, I'll assume there are two tables: `allergies` and `substances`. The `allergies` table has columns `id`, `stop_date`, and `substance_id`, and the `substances` table has columns `id` and `description`.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT a.stop_date FROM allergies a JOIN substances s ON a.substance_id = s.id WHERE s.description = 'Animal dander';

This query joins the `allergies` and `substances` tables on the `substance_id` foreign key, and then selects the `stop_date` column where the `description` in the `substances` table matches 'Animal dander'.",5.007686376571655

How many patients have or had the allergy with the code 419199007?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'How many patients have or had the allergy with the code 419199007?'

To answer this question, we need to join the `patients` table with the `allergies` table, as the allergy code is stored in the `allergies` table, and we want to count the number of patients who have or had this allergy.

[SQL]: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT p.id) FROM patients p LEFT JOIN allergies a ON p.id = a.patientid WHERE a.code = '419199007';

Here's a brief explanation of the query:

* We use a `LEFT JOIN` to ensure that we include all patients, even if they don't have an allergy with the specified code.
* We join the `patients` table with the `allergies` table on the `patientid` foreign key.
* We filter the results to only include rows where the `code` column in the `allergies` table matches the specified code '419199007'.
* We use `COUNT(DISTINCT p.id)` to count the number of unique patients who have or had this allergy.

[Q]: 'Please provide me the name of the payer associated with the encounter cd018604-4e95-4976-fd2d-5f69e91feb12.'

To answer this question, I'll assume there are three tables: `encounters`, `claims`, and `payers`. The `encounters` table has a foreign key `claimid` referencing the `id` column in the `claims` table. The `claims` table has a foreign key `payerid` referencing the `id` column in the `payers` table.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT p.name FROM encounters e 
        LEFT JOIN claims cl ON e.id = cl.encounterid 
        LEFT JOIN payers p ON cl.payerid = p.id 
        WHERE e.id = 'cd018604-4e95-4976-fd2d-5f69e91feb12';

This query joins the `encounters` table with the `claims` table on the `encounterid` column, and then joins the resulting table with the `payers` table on the `payerid` column. The `WHERE` clause filters the results to only include the encounter with the specified ID. Finally, the query selects the `name` column from the `payers` table, which corresponds to the name of the payer associated with the encounter.",5.34062647819519

[Q]: 'What is the stop date of the condition with code 314529007?'

To answer this question, I'll assume there are two tables: `conditions` and `codes`. The `conditions` table has columns `id`, `stop_date`, and `code_id`, and the `codes` table has columns `id` and `code`.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT c.stop_date FROM conditions c INNER JOIN codes cd ON c.code_id = cd.id WHERE cd.code = '314529007';

This query joins the `conditions` and `codes` tables on the `code_id` foreign key, and then filters the results to only include the row where the `code` column in the `codes` table matches the given code '314529007'. Finally, it selects the `stop_date` column from the `conditions` table.",7.1312806606292725

[SQL]: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT e.id) 
FROM encounters e 
JOIN claims c ON e.claimid = c.id 
JOIN payers p ON c.payerid = p.id 
WHERE p.name = 'NO_INSURANCE';

Here's a brief explanation of the query:

* We need to count the number of encounters, so we use the `COUNT(DISTINCT e.id)` aggregation function.
* We join the `encounters` table with the `claims` table on the `claimid` foreign key.
* We then join the `claims` table with the `payers` table on the `payerid` foreign key.
* We filter the results to only include encounters covered by the payer 'NO_INSURANCE' using the `WHERE` clause.

Note that I assumed the existence of the following tables and columns:

* `encounters` table with an `id` column and a `claimid` foreign key.
* `claims` table with an `id` column and a `payerid` foreign key.
* `payers` table with an `id` column and a `name` column.

If the actual table and column names differ, the query may need to be adjusted accordingly.",5.375821352005005
Please provide me the encounters that were related to the allergy Mold (organism).,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'Please provide me the encounters that were related to the allergy Mold (organism).'

To answer this question, I'll assume the following tables and columns:

* `allergies` table with columns `id`, `name`, and `organism`
* `encounter_allergies` table with columns `encounter_id` and `allergy_id` (foreign keys to `encounters` and `allergies` tables)
* `encounters` table with columns `id` and other relevant columns (e.g., `date`, `description`)

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: 
```
SELECT DISTINCT e.id, e.date, e.description 
FROM encounters e 
JOIN encounter_allergies ea ON e.id = ea.encounter_id 
JOIN allergies a ON ea.allergy_id = a.id 
WHERE a.name = 'Mold' AND a.organism = 'organism';
```

This query joins the `encounters`, `encounter_allergies`, and `allergies` tables using their respective foreign keys. It then filters the results to only include encounters related to the allergy 'Mold' with organism 'organism'. The `DISTINCT` keyword is used to remove duplicate encounters.",6.277898073196411

[Q]: 'Can you provide the count of patients suffering from the allergy with the code 782576004?'

To answer this question, I'll assume there are three tables: `patients`, `allergies`, and `patient_allergies`. The `patient_allergies` table is a junction table that connects patients with their allergies.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT p.id) 
FROM patients p 
JOIN patient_allergies pa ON p.id = pa.patientid 
JOIN allergies a ON pa.allergyid = a.id 
WHERE a.code = '782576004';

This query joins the `patients` table with the `patient_allergies` table on the `patientid` column, and then joins the result with the `allergies` table on the `allergyid` column. The `WHERE` clause filters the results to only include patients with the allergy code '782576004'.

* Then, we join the `allergies` table with the `patients` table on the `patientid` foreign key.
* We filter the results to only include rows where the `substance` name is 'Tree pollen'.
* We use the `COUNT` aggregation function to count the occurrences of each `procedure` and sort the results in descending order using the `ORDER BY` clause.
* Finally, we use the `LIMIT 1` clause to retrieve the most promising procedure, which is the one with the highest count.

Note: This query assumes that the `procedures` table is actually part of the `patients` table, as there is no separate `procedures` table mentioned in the notes or examples. If this is not the case, the query would need to be modified accordingly.",3.2651896476745605
What is the reason for performing the procedure Screening for drug abuse (procedure)?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the given question.

[Q]: 'What is the reason for performing the procedure Screening for drug abuse (procedure)?'

To answer this question, I'll assume there are two tables: `procedures` and `procedure_reasons`. The `procedures` table has columns `id`, `name`, and `procedure_id`, while the `procedure_reasons` table has columns `id`, `procedure_id`, and `reason`.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT pr.reason FROM procedures p INNER JOIN procedure_reasons pr ON p.id = pr.procedure_id WHERE p.name = 'Screening for drug abuse';

This query joins the `procedures` and `procedure_reasons` tables on the `procedure_id` foreign key, and then selects the `reason` column from the `procedure_reasons` table where the `name` column in the `procedures` table matches 'Screening for drug abuse'.",6.477006912231445
Please provide me the patients with the claim ID 108e5d55-e704-b869-eee7-4e2525abcca5.,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I can create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the given question.

[Q]: 'Please provide me the patients with the claim ID 108e5d55-e704-b869-eee7-4e2525abcca5.'

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT p.first, p.last FROM claims cl LEFT JOIN patients p ON cl.patientid= p.id WHERE cl.id='108e5d55-e704-b869-eee7-4e2525abcca5';

This query joins the `claims` table with the `patients` table on the `patientid` foreign key, and then filters the results to only include patients with the specified claim ID. The `DISTINCT` keyword is used to ensure that each patient is only listed once, even if they have multiple claims with the same ID.",6.18209171295166
Please provide me the patient associated with the imaging study entailing series UID 1.2.840.99999999.1.35521005.1677140787722.,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT p.first, p.last 
FROM imaging_studies is

WHERE s.uid = '1.2.840.99999999.1.35521005.1677140787722';

Here's the explanation:

* We need to join three tables: `imaging_studies`, `series`, and `patients`.
* We join `imaging_studies` with `series` on the `imaging_study_id` foreign key.
* We join `imaging_studies` with `patients` on the `patient_id` foreign key.
* We filter the results using the `WHERE` clause to only include the series with the specified UID.
* We use `SELECT DISTINCT` to retrieve unique patient names (first and last).",4.063214302062988
Give me the base cost of the immunization HPV  quadrivalent.,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[SQL]: SELECT base_cost FROM immunizations WHERE name='HPV quadrivalent';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the base cost of a specific immunization, which is 'HPV quadrivalent'.
* Since the question only mentions the immunization name, we can assume that the relevant table is 'immunizations'.
* We only need to query the 'base_cost' column, as per the question.
* We use the 'WHERE' clause to filter the results based on the immunization name.

Note: If the immunization name is not unique, we might need to use the 'DISTINCT' keyword to remove duplicates. However, in this case, it's not necessary as the question implies a specific immunization.",5.370595932006836
When was the observation with the code 8867-4 recorded?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT o.observation_date FROM observations o LEFT JOIN codes c ON o.code_id = c.id WHERE c.code = '8867-4';

Here's a brief explanation of the query:

* We're selecting the `observation_date` column from the `observations` table, which is the relevant column to answer the question.
* We're joining the `observations` table with the `codes` table using the `code_id` foreign key, as the question mentions a specific code.
* We're filtering the results to only include observations with the code '8867-4' using the `WHERE` clause.
* We're using `DISTINCT` to remove any duplicate observation dates, if there are any.

Note that this query assumes the existence of the `observations` and `codes` tables, with the corresponding columns and foreign key relationships. If the table structure is different, the query may need to be adjusted accordingly.",5.3330607414245605

[SQL]: SELECT p.income_status FROM patients p WHERE p.first='Caleb651' AND p.last='Dickinson688';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the income status of a specific patient, so we only need to query the `patients` table.
* We use the `WHERE` clause to filter the results based on the patient's first and last names, which are 'Caleb651' and 'Dickinson688', respectively.
* Since we only need the income status, we select only the `income_status` column from the `patients` table.

Note that this query assumes that the `income_status` column exists in the `patients` table. If this is not the case, please provide more information about the database schema.",4.354496479034424
Which ethnicity does the patient named Guadalupe206 Rangel145 have?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[SQL]: SELECT e.ethnicity FROM patients p LEFT JOIN ethnicity e ON p.ethnicityid = e.id WHERE p.first = 'Guadalupe206' AND p.last = 'Rangel145';

Here's how I constructed the query:

* I identified the relevant columns needed to answer the question: `ethnicity` from the `ethnicity` table and `first` and `last` from the `patients` table.
* I used the `LEFT JOIN` to combine the `patients` and `ethnicity` tables based on the foreign key `ethnicityid` in the `patients` table and the primary key `id` in the `ethnicity` table.
* I used the `WHERE` clause to filter the results to only include the patient with the specified first and last names.
* I didn't use `DISTINCT` in this case since we're looking for a specific patient's ethnicity, and it's unlikely to have multiple ethnicities associated with the same patient.",5.454030990600586
Please provide me the speciality of the provider named Tena12 Davis923.,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'Please provide me the speciality of the provider named Tena12 Davis923.'

To answer this question, I'll assume there are two tables: `providers` and `specialties`. The `providers` table has columns `id`, `first`, `last`, and `specialtyid`, and the `specialties` table has columns `id` and `name`.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT s.name FROM providers p LEFT JOIN specialties s ON p.specialtyid = s.id WHERE p.first='Tena12' AND p.last='Davis923';

This query joins the `providers` table with the `specialties` table on the `specialtyid` foreign key, and then filters the results to only include the provider with the specified first and last names. The `SELECT` statement only retrieves the `name` column from the `specialties` table, which corresponds to the specialty of the provider.",6.008804798126221
What is the encounter associated with the condition with code 314529007?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'What is the encounter associated with the condition with code 314529007?'

To answer this question, we need to join the `conditions` table with the `encounters` table. Assuming there is a foreign key `encounterid` in the `conditions` table that references the `id` column in the `encounters` table, we can write the following query:

[SQL]: 
SELECT DISTINCT e.id, e.date 
FROM conditions c 
JOIN encounters e ON c.encounterid = e.id 
WHERE c.code = '314529007';

This query joins the `conditions` table with the `encounters` table on the `encounterid` foreign key, and then filters the results to only include the encounter associated with the condition having the code '314529007'. The `SELECT` statement only retrieves the `id` and `date` columns from the `encounters` table, which are the relevant columns for this question.",5.365977764129639

[SQL]: SELECT p.city FROM providers p WHERE p.id='7974ed52-fd4b-3930-a29c-c2fcf06fa0df';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the city of the provider with a specific ID, so we only need to query the `providers` table.
* We use the `WHERE` clause to filter the results based on the provider ID mentioned in the question.
* Since we only need the city, we select only the `city` column from the `providers` table.

Note: If the provider ID is not found in the `providers` table, this query will return an empty result set.",4.922267198562622
When was the imaging study with series UID 1.2.840.99999999.1.88489911.1671313700106 conducted?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

FROM diagnoses d 
JOIN patients p ON d.patientid = p.id 
JOIN diagnosis_codes dc ON d.diagnosis = dc.code 
WHERE dc.description = 'House dust mite (organism)';
```

This query joins the `diagnoses` table with the `patients` table on the `patientid` foreign key, and then joins the `diagnosis_codes` table on the `diagnosis` code. It then filters the results to only include diagnoses with the description 'House dust mite (organism)' and finally counts the distinct patient IDs to give the total number of patients with this diagnosis.",5.1962902545928955

* The `implant_date` column is likely to be in the `devices` table, so we select that column.
* Since the question doesn't mention any other tables, we don't need to join any other tables.
* We use the `WHERE` clause to filter the results to only include the device with code 91537007.
* We use `DISTINCT` to ensure we get a single result, even if there are multiple records with the same implant date.

Note: If the `implant_date` column is actually in the `procedures` table, the query would need to be modified accordingly. For example:

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT p.implant_date FROM devices d LEFT JOIN procedures p ON d.id = p.deviceid WHERE d.code='91537007';",4.188812732696533

What is the reason for using the care plan with code 53950000?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[SQL]: SELECT cp.reason FROM care_plans cp WHERE cp.code='53950000';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the reason for using the care plan with code 53950000, so we only need to query the `care_plans` table.
* We use the `WHERE` clause to filter the results to only include the care plan with the specific code 53950000.
* We only select the `reason` column, as it's the only relevant column mentioned in the question.

Note: If the `care_plans` table has a foreign key referencing another table, and the question required joining with that table, I would use a `JOIN` clause accordingly. However, based on the provided information, it seems that the `care_plans` table has the necessary information to answer the question.",5.009280204772949
Can you provide the count of patients suffering from Allergy to substance (finding)?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

Assuming there are three tables: `patients`, `findings`, and `patient_findings` (a junction table to establish a many-to-many relationship between patients and findings).

Here's the SQL query:

```
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT p.id) 
FROM patients p 
JOIN patient_findings pf ON p.id = pf.patientid 
JOIN findings f ON pf.findingid = f.id 
WHERE f.name = 'Allergy to substance';
```

This query:

1. Joins the `patients` table with the `patient_findings` table on the `patientid` foreign key.
2. Joins the `patient_findings` table with the `findings` table on the `findingid` foreign key.
3. Filters the results to only include patients with a finding of 'Allergy to substance'.
4. Uses the `COUNT(DISTINCT p.id)` aggregation function to count the unique patients suffering from the specified finding.

Note: The exact table and column names might vary depending on the actual database schema. This query is based on the provided examples and notes.",5.347839832305908

JOIN payers p ON cl.payerid = p.id 
WHERE p.id='df166300-5a78-3502-a46a-832842197811';

Explanation:

* We need to count the number of medications, so we use the COUNT(DISTINCT m.id) function.
* We join the medications table with the claims table on the claimid foreign key.
* We then join the claims table with the payers table on the payerid foreign key.
* We filter the results to only include the payer with the specified ID using the WHERE clause.

Note: Assuming the table and column names are correct, this query should provide the desired result. If the table or column names are incorrect, please provide the correct information, and I'll be happy to assist you further.",5.104325771331787

[Q]: 'What is the description of the condition with code 314529007?'

To answer this question, I'll assume there is a table called ""conditions"" with columns ""code"" and ""description"". 

[SQL]: SELECT description FROM conditions WHERE code='314529007';",4.687728404998779
Please provide me the charge ID of the claim transaction fd469979-66c7-9ea7-7712-8f5c83868070.,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the given question.

[Q]: 'Please provide me the charge ID of the claim transaction fd469979-66c7-9ea7-7712-8f5c83868070.'

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT ct.chargeid FROM claim_transactions ct WHERE ct.id='fd469979-66c7-9ea7-7712-8f5c83868070';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the charge ID of a specific claim transaction, so we only need to query the `chargeid` column.
* The claim transaction ID is provided, so we can use it in the `WHERE` clause to filter the results.
* Since we're only interested in the `chargeid` column, we use `SELECT DISTINCT` to retrieve the unique value.
* We don't need to join any other tables, as the claim transaction ID is sufficient to identify the required charge ID.

Note: Assuming the table name is `claim_transactions` and the column names are `id` and `chargeid`. If the table or column names are different, the query would need to be adjusted accordingly.",5.187579870223999
What encounter is required during the use of the device Home continuous positive airway pressure unit (physical object)?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the given question.

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT e.name 
FROM devices d 
JOIN encounters_devices ed ON d.id = ed.deviceid 
JOIN encounters e ON ed.encounterid = e.id 
WHERE d.name = 'Home continuous positive airway pressure unit';

Here's a brief explanation of the query:

* We start by selecting the `name` column from the `encounters` table, which is the relevant column based on the question.
* We join the `devices` table with the `encounters_devices` table on the `deviceid` foreign key, as the question mentions a specific device.
* We then join the `encounters_devices` table with the `encounters` table on the `encounterid` foreign key, to link the device to the required encounter.
* Finally, we filter the results to only include the specific device mentioned in the question, 'Home continuous positive airway pressure unit', using the `WHERE` clause.

Note that I'm assuming the existence of the following tables and columns:

* `devices` table with columns `id` and `name`
* `encounters_devices` table with columns `deviceid` and `encounterid` (foreign keys)
* `encounters` table with columns `id` and `name`",6.263813257217407
When was the device with code 228869008 implanted or initially used?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT d.implant_date FROM devices d LEFT JOIN procedures p ON d.id = p.device_id WHERE d.code = '228869008';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the implant date of the device with code 228869008.
* We need to join the `devices` table with the `procedures` table using the foreign key `device_id`.
* We select the `implant_date` column from the `devices` table.
* We use the `WHERE` clause to filter the results for the device with code '228869008'.
* We use `DISTINCT` to remove any duplicate values, although in this case, it's unlikely to have multiple implant dates for the same device.

Note: If the `implant_date` column is not present in the `devices` table, and instead, it's present in the `procedures` table, the query would need to be modified accordingly.",6.306426525115967
Please provide me the modality code and description of the imaging study with the ID fcbd803f-8ac1-a6fb-1ea8-aa71925db967.,"Based on the provided question, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query. Here's the answer:

LEFT JOIN imaging_study_details isd ON isu.id = isd.imaging_study_id 
WHERE isu.id='fcbd803f-8ac1-a6fb-1ea8-aa71925db967';

This query joins the `imaging_studies` table with the `imaging_study_details` table on the `imaging_study_id` foreign key, and then filters the results to only include the row with the specified `id`. The `SELECT` statement only retrieves the `modality_code` and `description` columns, as requested in the question.",5.140198707580566
Who has received the immunization with code 140?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'Who has received the immunization with code 140?'

To answer this question, I'll assume there are two tables: `immunizations` and `patients`. The `immunizations` table has columns `id`, `patientid`, and `code`, and the `patients` table has columns `id`, `first`, and `last`. The `patientid` column in the `immunizations` table is a foreign key referencing the `id` column in the `patients` table.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT p.first, p.last FROM immunizations i LEFT JOIN patients p ON i.patientid = p.id WHERE i.code = 140;

This query joins the `immunizations` table with the `patients` table on the `patientid` column, and then filters the results to only include rows where the `code` column in the `immunizations` table is 140. The `SELECT DISTINCT` clause ensures that we only get unique patient names.",5.123144865036011
Please provide me patients with the observation Hematocrit [Volume Fraction] of Blood by Automated count.,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the given question.

Assuming we have the following tables:

* `patients` with columns `id`, `first`, `last`
* `claims` with columns `id`, `patientid`, `observation`
* `observations` with columns `id`, `claimid`, `name`, `value`

Here's the SQL query to answer the question:

```
SELECT DISTINCT p.first, p.last 
FROM patients p 
LEFT JOIN claims cl ON p.id = cl.patientid 
LEFT JOIN observations o ON cl.id = o.claimid 
WHERE o.name = 'Hematocrit [Volume Fraction] of Blood by Automated count';
```

This query joins the `patients` table with the `claims` table on the `patientid` foreign key, and then joins the resulting table with the `observations` table on the `claimid` foreign key. It then filters the results to only include patients with the specified observation.",5.074795246124268

FROM procedures p 
JOIN claims c ON p.claimid = c.id 
JOIN payers py ON c.payerid = py.id 
WHERE py.name = 'Dual Eligible' AND c.covered = FALSE;

Here's a brief explanation of the query:

* We're counting the distinct procedure IDs (`p.id`) that meet the conditions.
* We're joining the `procedures` table with the `claims` table on the `claimid` foreign key.
* We're joining the `claims` table with the `payers` table on the `payerid` foreign key.
* We're filtering the results to only include claims where the payer is 'Dual Eligible' and the claim is not covered (`c.covered = FALSE`).

Note that I'm assuming the existence of the following tables and columns:

* `procedures` table with an `id` column and a `claimid` foreign key.
* `claims` table with an `id` column, a `payerid` foreign key, and a `covered` column.
* `payers` table with an `id` column and a `name` column.

If these assumptions are incorrect, please provide more information about the database schema, and I'll be happy to adjust the query accordingly.",5.312161922454834

[SQL]: SELECT o.city FROM organizations o WHERE o.id='7f08f09e-c5f7-38cd-83ba-ddafedd88a13';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the city of the organization with a specific ID, so we only need to query the `organizations` table.
* We use the `WHERE` clause to filter the results based on the provided organization ID.
* Since we only need the city, we select only the `city` column from the `organizations` table.

Note: Assuming the `organizations` table has an `id` column and a `city` column. If the table structure is different, the query might need to be adjusted accordingly.",3.9414398670196533

Here's how I constructed the query:

* The question asks for the ethnicity of a specific patient, so we need to join the `patients` table with the `ethnicity` table.
* We use the `LEFT JOIN` to ensure we get all patients, even if they don't have an associated ethnicity.
* We join the tables on the `ethnicityid` foreign key in the `patients` table, which references the `id` column in the `ethnicity` table.
* We filter the results to only include the patient named 'Deckow585' by specifying the `first` and `last` names in the `WHERE` clause.
* Finally, we select only the `ethnicity` column from the `ethnicity` table, as that's the information we're interested in.",5.1372761726379395

[SQL]: SELECT d.diagnosis FROM claims cl LEFT JOIN diagnoses d ON cl.id = d.claimid WHERE cl.id='b8ce4a28-4cf5-e719-e332-90f2831e2b89';

Here's the explanation:

* We need to query the `diagnoses` table to get the diagnosis, but the question provides the claim ID, which is in the `claims` table. So, we need to join these two tables using the foreign key `claimid` in the `diagnoses` table.
* We use a LEFT JOIN to ensure we get the diagnosis even if there's no matching record in the `diagnoses` table.
* We filter the results using the WHERE clause to only consider the claim with the specified ID.
* Finally, we select only the `diagnosis` column from the `diagnoses` table, as that's what the question asks for.",4.336349010467529

[Q]: 'What is the body site code of the imaging study with the ID 2353ce88-d0f6-52c4-84ca-d0133a951597?'

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT i.body_site_code FROM imaging_studies i WHERE i.id='2353ce88-d0f6-52c4-84ca-d0133a951597';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the body site code of a specific imaging study with a given ID.
* Since the question only mentions the imaging study ID, we only need to query the `imaging_studies` table.
* We use the `SELECT DISTINCT` statement to retrieve the unique `body_site_code` value for the specified imaging study ID.
* The `WHERE` clause filters the results to only include the imaging study with the ID `2353ce88-d0f6-52c4-84ca-d0133a951597`.",7.068503141403198

[SQL]: SELECT o.address FROM organizations o WHERE o.name='BAYADA HOME HEALTH CARE  INC';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the address of a specific organization, so we only need to query the `organizations` table.
* We use the `WHERE` clause to filter the results to only include the organization with the name 'BAYADA HOME HEALTH CARE  INC'.
* Since we only need the address, we only select the `address` column.

Note: If the `organizations` table has a separate table for addresses, we would need to use a `JOIN` to retrieve the address. However, based on the provided information, it seems that the address is stored in the `organizations` table itself.",5.0762693881988525
Please provide me the encounters that were related to the procedure with code 713106006.,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the given question.

Here's the answer:

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT e.* FROM procedures p 
JOIN encounters e ON p.encounterid = e.id 
WHERE p.code = '713106006';

Explanation:

* We need to query the encounters table to get the required information.
* The question mentions a specific procedure code, so we need to join the procedures table with the encounters table using the encounterid foreign key.
* We use the WHERE clause to filter the results based on the procedure code mentioned in the question.
* We use SELECT DISTINCT to ensure we get unique encounter records.

Note: Assuming the tables and columns are named as follows:

[SQL]: SELECT e.encounter FROM care_plans cp 
JOIN encounters e ON cp.encounterid = e.id 
WHERE cp.code = '443402002';

Here's a brief explanation of the query:

* We need to find the encounter where the care plan with code 443402002 was administered, so we start by selecting the `encounter` column from the `encounters` table.
* We join the `care_plans` table with the `encounters` table on the `encounterid` foreign key, which links a care plan to an encounter.
* We filter the results to only include the care plan with code 443402002 using the `WHERE` clause.

Note that I've assumed the existence of the `encounterid` foreign key in the `care_plans` table, which links to the `id` column in the `encounters` table. If this assumption is incorrect, please provide more information about the table schema.",6.105593204498291

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT i.body_site_code FROM imaging_studies i WHERE i.id='781242f7-dd9c-8a26-181a-65898eb64eb4';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the body site code of the imaging study with a specific ID.
* Since the question only mentions the imaging study ID, we only need to query the `imaging_studies` table.
* We use the `SELECT DISTINCT` statement to retrieve the unique `body_site_code` value.
* We filter the results using the `WHERE` clause with the provided imaging study ID.

Note: If the `body_site_code` column is not present in the `imaging_studies` table, the query would need to be modified to join with another table that contains this column, using the appropriate foreign key. However, based on the provided information, it seems that the `body_site_code` column is part of the `imaging_studies` table.",5.140896558761597

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the name of the provider with a specific ID, so we only need to query the `providers` table.
* We use the `WHERE` clause to filter the results based on the provided ID.
* Since we only need the name of the provider, we select only the `first` and `last` columns.
* We use `DISTINCT` to ensure we get a single result, even if there are multiple rows with the same ID (although this is unlikely, given the ID is unique).

JOIN coverage c ON m.id = c.medicationid 
JOIN payers p ON c.payerid = p.id 
WHERE p.name = 'Medicaid';

Explanation:

* We need to count the number of medications covered by the payer Medicaid, so we use the COUNT(DISTINCT m.id) function to get the unique count of medications.
* We join the medications table with the coverage table on the medicationid foreign key.
* We then join the coverage table with the payers table on the payerid foreign key.
* Finally, we filter the results to only include rows where the payer name is 'Medicaid'.",5.366098403930664
Please provide me the encounters that are related to the device with code 337414009.,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT e.* 
FROM devices d 
JOIN encounters e ON d.id = e.deviceid 
WHERE d.code = '337414009';

Here's a brief explanation of the query:

* We start by selecting all columns (`*`) from the `encounters` table, which is aliased as `e`.
* We join the `devices` table, aliased as `d`, with the `encounters` table on the condition that the `id` column in `devices` matches the `deviceid` column in `encounters`. This is based on the assumption that there is a foreign key relationship between the two tables.
* We filter the results to only include encounters related to the device with the code `337414009` using the `WHERE` clause.

Note that I'm assuming the existence of a foreign key relationship between the `devices` and `encounters` tables, and that the `deviceid` column in `encounters` references the `id` column in `devices`. If this is not the case, the query may need to be adjusted accordingly.",5.405484914779663

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the SOP code of a specific imaging study with a given ID.
* Since the question only mentions the imaging study ID, we don't need to join any other tables.
* We use the `DISTINCT` keyword to ensure we get a single, unique SOP code (in case there are duplicates, which is unlikely in this case).
* We select only the `sop` column from the `imaging_studies` table, which is the relevant column for the question.
* We filter the results using the `WHERE` clause to only include the imaging study with the specified ID.",5.588551759719849

Here's the answer:

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT e.* FROM encounters e 
JOIN immunizations i ON e.id = i.encounterid 
WHERE i.code = 140;

Explanation:

* We need to query the `encounters` table to get the required information.
* Since the question mentions ""related to the immunization with code 140"", we need to join the `immunizations` table with the `encounters` table using the foreign key `encounterid`.
* We filter the results to only include immunizations with code 140 using the `WHERE` clause.
* We use `SELECT DISTINCT` to ensure we get unique encounter records.
* We use `e.*` to select all columns from the `encounters` table, as the question doesn't specify which columns are required.",4.99261474609375
What are the survival chances of allgery Shellfish (substance)?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

Since the question asks about the survival chances of an allergy to Shellfish (substance), I'll assume there are tables for allergies, substances, and possibly a table for survival chances or outcomes.

Let's assume the table structure is as follows:

* `allergies` table with columns `id`, `substance_id`, and `survival_chance`
* `substances` table with columns `id` and `name`
* `outcomes` table with columns `id`, `allergy_id`, and `survival_chance`

Here's the SQL query to answer the question:

```
SELECT a.survival_chance 
FROM allergies a 
JOIN substances s ON a.substance_id = s.id 
WHERE s.name = 'Shellfish';
```

This query joins the `allergies` table with the `substances` table on the `substance_id` foreign key, and then filters the results to only include the row where the substance name is 'Shellfish'. The `SELECT` statement only retrieves the `survival_chance` column, which is the relevant information for the question.

Note: If the table structure is different or there are additional tables involved, the query might need to be adjusted accordingly.",5.4323835372924805

The `SELECT DISTINCT e.*` clause retrieves all columns (`*`) from the `encounters` table, and the `DISTINCT` keyword ensures that only unique encounters are returned.",6.344918251037598
Who has been treated for the condition with code 840544004?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'Who has been treated for the condition with code 840544004?'

To answer this question, we need to join the `conditions` table with the `patients` table through the `treatments` table, as a treatment is associated with a condition and a patient.

[SQL]: 
SELECT DISTINCT p.first, p.last 
FROM treatments t 
JOIN conditions c ON t.conditionid = c.id 
JOIN patients p ON t.patientid = p.id 
WHERE c.code = '840544004';",5.843854904174805
Which illness is most common in warmer climates?,"To answer this question, we need to assume that there are tables for `patients`, `claims`, `illnesses`, and `locations`. We also need to assume that `locations` have a column for `climate` and `patients` have a column for `location_id` which is a foreign key referencing the `id` column in the `locations` table.

Here's a possible SQL query:

```
SELECT i.name, COUNT(DISTINCT p.id) as count
FROM patients p
JOIN locations l ON p.location_id = l.id
JOIN claims cl ON p.id = cl.patientid
JOIN illnesses i ON cl.illnessid = i.id
WHERE l.climate = 'warmer'
GROUP BY i.name
ORDER BY count DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

This query joins the `patients`, `locations`, `claims`, and `illnesses` tables to get the count of each illness in warmer climates. It then groups the results by illness name and orders them in descending order of count. The `LIMIT 1` clause is used to get the most common illness.

Here's a brief explanation of the query:

* We're counting the distinct immunization IDs (`i.id`) to get the number of immunizations.
* We're joining the `immunizations` table with the `claims` table on the `claimid` foreign key.
* We're joining the `claims` table with the `payers` table on the `payerid` foreign key.
* We're filtering the results to only include immunizations where the payer is 'Medicare' and the claim is not covered (`c.covered = false`).",5.240875482559204
On which date was the allergy Aspirin recorded?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

Since the question asks about the date when the allergy ""Aspirin"" was recorded, I'll assume there are two tables: ""allergies"" and ""patients"". The ""allergies"" table has columns ""id"", ""patientid"", ""allergen"", and ""recorded_date"", and the ""patients"" table has columns ""id"", ""first"", and ""last"". The foreign key is ""patientid"" in the ""allergies"" table, which references the ""id"" column in the ""patients"" table.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT recorded_date FROM allergies WHERE allergen='Aspirin';

This query directly queries the ""allergies"" table, filtering the results to only include the row where the ""allergen"" column is 'Aspirin', and returns the corresponding ""recorded_date"".",5.0236217975616455

FROM observations o 
JOIN patients p ON o.patientid = p.id 
JOIN codes c ON o.codeid = c.id 
WHERE c.code = '8480-6';

Here's the explanation:

* We need to join three tables: observations, patients, and codes.
* The foreign key in the observations table that references the patients table is patientid, so we use that for the first JOIN.
* The foreign key in the observations table that references the codes table is codeid, so we use that for the second JOIN.
* We filter the results to only include observations with the code '8480-6'.
* We select only the first and last names of the patients, as per the question.",5.040079116821289
What is the stop date of the procedure with the code 171207006?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'What is the stop date of the procedure with the code 171207006?'

To answer this question, I'll assume there are two tables: `procedures` and `procedure_codes`. The `procedures` table has columns `id`, `stop_date`, and `procedure_code_id`, and the `procedure_codes` table has columns `id` and `code`.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT p.stop_date FROM procedures p INNER JOIN procedure_codes pc ON p.procedure_code_id = pc.id WHERE pc.code = '171207006';

This query joins the `procedures` table with the `procedure_codes` table on the `procedure_code_id` foreign key, and then filters the results to only include the procedure with the code '171207006'. The `SELECT` statement only retrieves the `stop_date` column, which is the relevant information requested in the question.",5.098838567733765
How many new employees have been hired in the past month?,"To answer this question, I'll assume there are two tables: `employees` and `hiring_info`. The `employees` table has columns `id`, `first`, `last`, and the `hiring_info` table has columns `employee_id` (foreign key referencing `employees.id`), `hire_date`.

Here's the SQL query:

```
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT e.id) 
FROM employees e 
JOIN hiring_info hi ON e.id = hi.employee_id 
WHERE hi.hire_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '1 month';
```

This query joins the `employees` table with the `hiring_info` table on the `employee_id` foreign key. It then counts the distinct `id`s of employees who have a `hire_date` within the past month.",6.443972110748291

[SQL]: SELECT p.birthdate FROM patients p WHERE p.first='Lala778' AND p.last='Labadie908';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the birthdate of a specific patient, so we only need to query the `patients` table.
* We use the `WHERE` clause to filter the results based on the patient's first and last names, which are 'Lala778' and 'Labadie908', respectively.
* Since we're only interested in the birthdate, we select only the `birthdate` column from the `patients` table.

Note that this query assumes that the `first` and `last` columns in the `patients` table contain the patient's first and last names, respectively, and that the `birthdate` column contains the patient's birthdate. If the column names or table structure are different, the query would need to be adjusted accordingly.",5.070427894592285
Please provide description of the encounters that are linked with the organization WOONSOCKET URGENT CARE PC.,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT e.description 
FROM encounters e 
JOIN organizations o ON e.organizationid = o.id 
WHERE o.name = 'WOONSOCKET URGENT CARE PC';

Here's a brief explanation of the query:

* We're selecting the `description` column from the `encounters` table, as that's what the question asks for.
* We're joining the `encounters` table with the `organizations` table on the `organizationid` foreign key, which links an encounter to an organization.
* We're filtering the results to only include encounters linked with the organization 'WOONSOCKET URGENT CARE PC' by specifying the `name` column in the `WHERE` clause.

[Q]: 'Can you give me the SNOMED code for the allergy with the description Lisinopril?'

[SQL]: SELECT a.snomed_code FROM allergies a WHERE a.description='Lisinopril';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the SNOMED code of the allergy with a specific description, so we only need to query the `allergies` table.
* We use the `WHERE` clause to filter the results based on the description 'Lisinopril'.
* Since we only need the SNOMED code, we select only the `snomed_code` column.

Note: If the `allergies` table has a foreign key referencing another table, and the question required joining with that table, I would use a `JOIN` clause accordingly. However, based on the provided information, it seems that the `allergies` table has the necessary information to answer the question.",6.114640235900879
What is the procedure code of the claim transaction 039d2cad-a241-ab5f-7046-d30342147e9d?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'What is the procedure code of the claim transaction 039d2cad-a241-ab5f-7046-d30342147e9d?'

To answer this question, I'll assume there are two tables: `claims` and `procedures`. The `claims` table has a column `id` which is the claim transaction ID, and the `procedures` table has a column `claim_id` which is a foreign key referencing the `id` column in the `claims` table. The `procedures` table also has a column `code` which stores the procedure code.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT p.code FROM claims cl LEFT JOIN procedures p ON cl.id = p.claim_id WHERE cl.id='039d2cad-a241-ab5f-7046-d30342147e9d';

This query joins the `claims` table with the `procedures` table on the `claim_id` foreign key, and then filters the results to only include the row with the specified claim transaction ID. The `SELECT` statement only retrieves the `code` column from the `procedures` table, which is the procedure code associated with the given claim transaction.",5.232706308364868

[Q]: 'What is the specialty of the provider named Nicholas495 Greenfelder433?'

To answer this question, I'll assume there are two tables: `providers` and `specialties`. The `providers` table has columns `id`, `first`, `last`, and `specialtyid`, and the `specialties` table has columns `id` and `name`.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT s.name FROM providers p LEFT JOIN specialties s ON p.specialtyid = s.id WHERE p.first = 'Nicholas495' AND p.last = 'Greenfelder433';

This query joins the `providers` table with the `specialties` table on the `specialtyid` foreign key, and then filters the results to find the provider with the specified first and last names. The `SELECT` statement only retrieves the `name` column from the `specialties` table, which corresponds to the provider's specialty.",6.087201833724976
When was the device with code 702172008 implanted or initially used?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT d.implant_date FROM devices d LEFT JOIN procedures p ON d.id = p.device_id WHERE d.code = '702172008';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the implant date of the device with code 702172008.
* We need to query the `devices` table to get the device with the specified code.
* The `implant_date` column is likely to be in the `devices` table, so we select that column.
* Since the question mentions ""implanted or initially used"", we might need to consider the `procedures` table as well, which could have information about when the device was used. We use a LEFT JOIN to connect the `devices` table with the `procedures` table on the `device_id` foreign key.
* We filter the results to only include the device with code '702172008' using the WHERE clause.

Note that if the `implant_date` column is not in the `devices` table, but rather in the `procedures` table, the query would need to be adjusted accordingly.",6.174363374710083
What is the total cost of the medication Hydrochlorothiazide 25 MG Oral Tablet?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

Assuming we have the following tables:

* `medications` with columns `id`, `name`, and `dosage`
* `prescriptions` with columns `id`, `medicationid` (foreign key referencing `medications.id`), and `cost`
* `claims` with columns `id`, `prescriptionid` (foreign key referencing `prescriptions.id`)

Here's the SQL query to answer the question:

```
SELECT SUM(p.cost) AS total_cost
FROM prescriptions p
JOIN medications m ON p.medicationid = m.id
WHERE m.name = 'Hydrochlorothiazide 25 MG Oral Tablet';
```

This query joins the `prescriptions` table with the `medications` table on the `medicationid` foreign key, and then filters the results to only include the medication with the specified name. The `SUM` aggregation function is used to calculate the total cost of the medication.",5.06838321685791

FROM members m 
JOIN payers p ON m.payerid = p.id 
WHERE p.id = '734afbd6-4794-363b-9bc0-6a3981533ed5';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the total number of months a payer with a specific ID has been a member.
* We need to join the `members` table with the `payers` table on the `payerid` foreign key.
* We use the `DATEDIFF` function to calculate the difference between the current date and the `startdate` of the member.
* Since we want the result in months, we divide the result by 30.
* We use the `SUM` aggregation function to calculate the total number of months.
* Finally, we filter the result to only include the payer with the specified ID.",6.397827625274658

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the body site code and description of the imaging study with a specific ID.
* Since the question only mentions the imaging study, we only need to query the `imaging_studies` table.
* We use the `SELECT DISTINCT` statement to retrieve unique values for the `body_site_code` and `body_site_description` columns.
* We filter the results using the `WHERE` clause to only include the imaging study with the specified ID.

Note that if the `body_site_code` and `body_site_description` columns are not present in the `imaging_studies` table, the query would need to be modified to join with another table that contains these columns, using the appropriate foreign key. However, based on the provided information, it seems that these columns are part of the `imaging_studies` table.",6.1807286739349365

How many encounters are uncovered by the payer Medicare?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'How many encounters are uncovered by the payer Medicare?'

To answer this question, I'll assume there are two tables: `encounters` and `payers`. The `encounters` table has a foreign key `payer_id` that references the `id` column in the `payers` table.

[SQL]: 
```
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT e.id) 
FROM encounters e 
JOIN payers p ON e.payer_id = p.id 
WHERE p.name = 'Medicare' AND e.covered = FALSE;
```

Here's the explanation:

* We need to count the number of encounters that are uncovered by the payer Medicare.
* We join the `encounters` table with the `payers` table on the `payer_id` foreign key.
* We filter the results to only include encounters where the payer is Medicare (`p.name = 'Medicare'`) and the encounter is not covered (`e.covered = FALSE`).
* We use `COUNT(DISTINCT e.id)` to count the number of unique encounters that meet the conditions.

Note: The assumption is that the `encounters` table has a column `covered` that indicates whether the encounter is covered or not, and the `payers` table has a column `name` that stores the payer's name. If the column names are different, the query should be adjusted accordingly.",5.860292673110962

[SQL]: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT p.id) 
FROM patients p 
JOIN allergies a ON p.id = a.patientid 
JOIN substances s ON a.substanceid = s.id 
WHERE s.name = 'Eggs (edible)';

Explanation:

* We need to count the number of patients suffering from a specific substance, so we'll use the `COUNT` aggregate function with `DISTINCT` to avoid counting the same patient multiple times.
* We'll join three tables: `patients`, `allergies`, and `substances`.
* We'll use the foreign keys to join the tables: `patientid` in `allergies` references `id` in `patients`, and `substanceid` in `allergies` references `id` in `substances`.
* We'll filter the results to only include patients with an allergy to 'Eggs (edible)' by specifying the `WHERE` clause.

Please provide me the number of procedures uncovered by the payer with the ID 8fa6c185-e44e-3e34-8bd8-39be8694f4ce.,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the given question.

[Q]: 'Please provide me the number of procedures uncovered by the payer with the ID 8fa6c185-e44e-3e34-8bd8-39be8694f4ce.'

To answer this question, I'll assume there are three tables: `payers`, `claims`, and `procedures`. The `payers` table has a column `id`, the `claims` table has columns `id`, `payerid`, and `procedureid`, and the `procedures` table has columns `id` and `covered`.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: 
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT p.id) 
FROM payers py 
JOIN claims cl ON py.id = cl.payerid 
JOIN procedures p ON cl.procedureid = p.id 
WHERE py.id = '8fa6c185-e44e-3e34-8bd8-39be8694f4ce' AND p.covered = FALSE;

This query joins the `payers`, `claims`, and `procedures` tables using their respective foreign keys. It then filters the results to only include procedures that are not covered (i.e., `p.covered = FALSE`) by the payer with the specified ID. Finally, it counts the distinct number of procedures that meet these conditions.",6.328330993652344

[SQL]: SELECT ct.amount FROM claim_transactions ct WHERE ct.id='f4595d96-3cdb-0e82-19f3-624b0c7638ed';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the amount transacted, so we only need to select the `amount` column.
* The question provides a specific `claim transaction ID`, so we can use that to filter the results in the `WHERE` clause.
* Since the question only mentions the `claim transaction ID`, we don't need to join any other tables. We can directly query the `claim_transactions` table.

Note: Assuming the `claim_transactions` table has an `id` column that matches the provided `claim transaction ID`, and an `amount` column that stores the transacted amount.",6.1333558559417725

WHERE a.allergen = 'Lisinopril';

Explanation:

* We need to query the `encounters` table to get the required information.
* Since the question mentions ""related to the allergy Lisinopril"", we need to join the `allergies` table with the `encounters` table using the foreign key `encounterid`.
* We filter the results to only include encounters related to the specific allergy 'Lisinopril' using the `WHERE` clause.
* We use `DISTINCT` to remove duplicate encounters, if any.
* We select only the relevant columns `id`, `date`, and `description` from the `encounters` table.",7.0361645221710205

To answer this question, I assume there are two tables: `procedures` and `procedure_codes`. The `procedures` table has columns `id`, `description`, and the `procedure_codes` table has columns `id`, `procedure_id` (foreign key referencing `procedures.id`), and `code`.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT p.description FROM procedures p JOIN procedure_codes pc ON p.id = pc.procedure_id WHERE pc.code = 167271000;

This query joins the `procedures` table with the `procedure_codes` table on the `procedure_id` foreign key, and then filters the results to only include the row where the `code` column matches the given value (167271000). The `SELECT` statement only retrieves the `description` column, which is the desired output.",5.108112573623657

WHERE p.procedure = 'Depression screening using Patient Health Questionnaire Two-Item score';

Here's the explanation:

* We need to find the encounter where the specific procedure was performed, so we start by selecting the `encounter` column from the `encounters` table.
* We join the `procedures` table with the `encounters` table on the `encounterid` foreign key.
* We filter the results to only include the specific procedure mentioned in the question using the `WHERE` clause.

Note: I assume that the `procedures` table has a column named `procedure` that contains the procedure names, and the `encounters` table has a column named `encounter` that contains the encounter information. If the column names are different, please adjust the query accordingly.",6.071252822875977
Who is the patient associated with the supply with the code 8537005?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'Who is the patient associated with the supply with the code 8537005?'

To answer this question, we need to join the `supplies` table with the `patients` table through the `claims` table, as the `claims` table has foreign keys to both `supplies` and `patients`.

[SQL]: 
```
SELECT DISTINCT p.first, p.last 
FROM supplies s 
JOIN claims cl ON s.id = cl.supplyid 
JOIN patients p ON cl.patientid = p.id 
WHERE s.code = '8537005';
```

This query joins the `supplies` table with the `claims` table on the `supplyid` column, and then joins the `claims` table with the `patients` table on the `patientid` column. It then filters the results to only include the patient associated with the supply with the code `8537005`.

What encounter is required during the use of the device Patient lifting system (physical object)?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the given question.

[Q]: 'What encounter is required during the use of the device Patient lifting system (physical object)?'

To answer this question, I'll assume there are three tables: `devices`, `encounters`, and `device_encounters` (a junction table to establish the many-to-many relationship between devices and encounters).

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: 
SELECT DISTINCT e.name 
FROM devices d 
JOIN device_encounters de ON d.id = de.deviceid 
JOIN encounters e ON de.encounterid = e.id 
WHERE d.name = 'Patient lifting system';

This query joins the `devices` table with the `device_encounters` table on the `deviceid` foreign key, and then joins the result with the `encounters` table on the `encounterid` foreign key. The `WHERE` clause filters the results to only include the device with the name 'Patient lifting system'.

Please provide me the encounters that were related to the procedure with code 180256009.,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the given question.

Here's the answer:

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT e.* FROM procedures p 
JOIN encounters e ON p.encounterid = e.id 
WHERE p.code = '180256009';

Explanation:

* We need to query the `encounters` table to get the relevant encounters.
* Since the question mentions a specific procedure code, we need to join the `procedures` table with the `encounters` table using the `encounterid` foreign key.
* We use the `WHERE` clause to filter the results based on the procedure code '180256009'.
* We use `SELECT DISTINCT` to ensure we get unique encounter records.
* We use `e.*` to select all columns from the `encounters` table, as the question doesn't specify which columns are required.",5.44091796875

[SQL]: SELECT e.encounter FROM procedures p 
JOIN encounters e ON p.encounterid = e.id 
WHERE p.procedure = 'Induced termination of pregnancy';

Here's a brief explanation of the query:

* We need to find the encounter where the procedure 'Induced termination of pregnancy' was performed.
* We join the `procedures` table with the `encounters` table on the `encounterid` foreign key.
* We filter the results to only include rows where the `procedure` column matches the desired value.
* We select only the `encounter` column from the `encounters` table, as it's the relevant information for the question.",4.924341917037964
Please provide me the claim ID of the claim transaction b62de2ba-9709-6cda-97f6-5c867a681bcb.,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the given question.

[Q]: 'Please provide me the claim ID of the claim transaction b62de2ba-9709-6cda-97f6-5c867a681bcb.'

[SQL]: SELECT cl.id FROM claim_transactions ct LEFT JOIN claims cl ON ct.claimid = cl.id WHERE ct.id='b62de2ba-9709-6cda-97f6-5c867a681bcb';

This query joins the `claim_transactions` table with the `claims` table on the `claimid` foreign key, and then selects the `id` column from the `claims` table where the `id` in the `claim_transactions` table matches the given transaction ID.",4.944638729095459
Please provide me the body site code and description of the imaging study with the ID 213a16c6-431c-6a7d-7e92-e270cb295ff4.,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'Please provide me the body site code and description of the imaging study with the ID 213a16c6-431c-6a7d-7e92-e270cb295ff4.'

To answer this question, I'll assume there are two tables: `imaging_studies` and `body_sites`. The `imaging_studies` table has a foreign key `body_site_id` that references the `id` column in the `body_sites` table.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT bs.code, bs.description FROM imaging_studies is LEFT JOIN body_sites bs ON is.body_site_id = bs.id WHERE is.id='213a16c6-431c-6a7d-7e92-e270cb295ff4';

This query joins the `imaging_studies` table with the `body_sites` table on the `body_site_id` foreign key, and then filters the results to only include the row with the specified `id` in the `imaging_studies` table. The `SELECT` statement only retrieves the `code` and `description` columns from the `body_sites` table, as requested in the question.",5.268615484237671
Please provide me the modality description of the imaging study with the ID 5ad9a317-b195-585e-c638-29e057061c9e.,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'Please provide me the modality description of the imaging study with the ID 5ad9a317-b195-585e-c638-29e057061c9e.'

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT i.modality_description FROM imaging_studies i WHERE i.id='5ad9a317-b195-585e-c638-29e057061c9e';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the modality description of a specific imaging study with a given ID.
* Since the question only mentions the imaging study ID, we can directly query the `imaging_studies` table.
* We use the `SELECT DISTINCT` statement to retrieve the unique modality description for the specified imaging study ID.
* The `WHERE` clause filters the result to only include the imaging study with the ID `5ad9a317-b195-585e-c638-29e057061c9e`.",6.185367584228516

[SQL]: SELECT i.study_date FROM imaging_studies i LEFT JOIN series s ON i.id = s.imaging_study_id WHERE s.uid='1.2.840.99999999.1.20409606.1674515871722';

Here's a brief explanation of the query:

* We're selecting the `study_date` column from the `imaging_studies` table, which is the relevant column based on the question.
* We're joining the `imaging_studies` table with the `series` table using the foreign key `imaging_study_id` to link the two tables.
* We're filtering the results using the `WHERE` clause to only include the row with the specific `uid` value mentioned in the question.

Note that I'm assuming the existence of the `imaging_studies` and `series` tables, as well as the `study_date` and `uid` columns, based on the provided context. If the actual table and column names differ, the query would need to be adjusted accordingly.",6.153692007064819

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT a.state FROM patients p LEFT JOIN addresses a ON p.addressid = a.id WHERE p.id='317fb5ba-6aeb-7868-faf7-79b87493ce77';

Here's the explanation:

* We need to find the state of the patient with the ID 317fb5ba-6aeb-7868-faf7-79b87493ce77.
* The patient's ID is used to join the `patients` table with the `addresses` table, assuming there's a foreign key `addressid` in the `patients` table that references the `id` column in the `addresses` table.
* We only need the `state` column from the `addresses` table, so we select only that column.
* We use `DISTINCT` to ensure we get a single state value, even if there are multiple addresses for the patient (although this is unlikely).
* The `WHERE` clause filters the results to only include the patient with the specified ID.",6.15037202835083
What is the name of the supply with the code 463659001?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'What is the name of the supply with the code 463659001?'

To answer this question, I'll assume there are two tables: `supplies` and `supply_codes`. The `supply_codes` table has columns `id`, `supply_id`, and `code`, and the `supplies` table has columns `id` and `name`.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT s.name FROM supply_codes sc INNER JOIN supplies s ON sc.supply_id = s.id WHERE sc.code = '463659001';

This query joins the `supply_codes` table with the `supplies` table on the `supply_id` foreign key, and then filters the results to only include the supply with the code `463659001`. The `SELECT` statement only retrieves the `name` column from the `supplies` table.",5.018094301223755
Which encounter is related to the allergy with the code 84489001?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'Which encounter is related to the allergy with the code 84489001?'

To answer this question, we need to join the `allergies` table with the `encounters` table. Assuming there is a foreign key `encounterid` in the `allergies` table that references the `id` column in the `encounters` table, and a foreign key `allergyid` in the `encounter_allergies` table that references the `id` column in the `allergies` table, we can write the following query:

[SQL]: 
SELECT DISTINCT e.id, e.date 
FROM allergies a 
JOIN encounter_allergies ea ON a.id = ea.allergyid 
JOIN encounters e ON ea.encounterid = e.id 
WHERE a.code = '84489001';

This query joins the `allergies` table with the `encounter_allergies` table on the `allergyid` column, and then joins the result with the `encounters` table on the `encounterid` column. It then filters the results to only include the encounter related to the allergy with the code '84489001'. The `DISTINCT` keyword is used to remove duplicate rows.",6.3804075717926025

[SQL]: SELECT o.city FROM organizations o WHERE o.id='6e517750-a29e-3170-a02b-5733ff523458';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the city of the organization with a specific ID, so we only need to query the `organizations` table.
* We use the `WHERE` clause to filter the results based on the provided organization ID.
* Since we only need the city, we select only the `city` column from the `organizations` table.

Note: Assuming the `organizations` table has an `id` column and a `city` column. If the table structure is different, the query might need to be adjusted accordingly.",4.960635423660278
How long does Hydrochlorothiazide 25 MG Oral Tablet effect last?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

However, I must point out that the question ""How long does Hydrochlorothiazide 25 MG Oral Tablet effect last?"" cannot be directly answered with a SQL query because the duration of the effect is not a column in any table. It's a piece of information that might be stored in a specific column or table, but it's not explicitly mentioned.

Assuming there's a table called ""medications"" with columns ""name"", ""dosage"", ""form"", and ""effect_duration"", and another table called ""drug_effects"" with columns ""medication_id"" and ""effect_duration"", I can provide a possible SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT m.name, m.dosage, m.form, de.effect_duration 
FROM medications m 
JOIN drug_effects de ON m.id = de.medication_id 
WHERE m.name = 'Hydrochlorothiazide' AND m.dosage = '25 MG' AND m.form = 'Oral Tablet';

Please note that this query is based on assumptions about the table structure and column names, which might not be accurate. If the actual table structure and column names are different, the query would need to be adjusted accordingly.",6.231935739517212

[SQL]: SELECT p.specialty FROM providers p WHERE p.id='248847e3-0acd-3cde-ab68-60658d5f8ed7';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the specialty of a specific provider with a given ID.
* Since the question only mentions the provider's ID, we can directly query the `providers` table.
* We use the `WHERE` clause to filter the result based on the provided ID.
* The `SELECT` statement only includes the `specialty` column, as it's the only relevant information requested in the question.",4.928749322891235
What is the reason code for the procedure Assessment of substance use (procedure)?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'What is the reason code for the procedure Assessment of substance use (procedure)?'

To answer this question, I'll assume there are two tables: `procedures` and `reason_codes`. The `procedures` table has columns `id`, `name`, and `reason_code_id`, and the `reason_codes` table has columns `id` and `code`.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT rc.code FROM procedures p INNER JOIN reason_codes rc ON p.reason_code_id = rc.id WHERE p.name = 'Assessment of substance use';

This query joins the `procedures` table with the `reason_codes` table on the `reason_code_id` foreign key, and then selects the `code` column from the `reason_codes` table where the `name` column in the `procedures` table matches 'Assessment of substance use'.",5.041382312774658

[Q]: 'Please provide me the number of procedures covered by the payer with the ID 0133f751-9229-3cfd-815f-b6d4979bdd6a.'

To answer this question, I'll assume there are two tables: `payers` and `procedures`. The `payers` table has a column `id` with the payer's ID, and the `procedures` table has a column `payerid` that references the `id` column in the `payers` table, indicating the payer covering the procedure.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT p.id) FROM procedures p INNER JOIN payers py ON p.payerid = py.id WHERE py.id='0133f751-9229-3cfd-815f-b6d4979bdd6a';

This query joins the `procedures` table with the `payers` table on the `payerid` and `id` columns, respectively. It then filters the results to only include procedures covered by the payer with the specified ID. Finally, it counts the distinct procedure IDs to provide the number of procedures covered by the payer.",6.50597620010376

[Q]: 'Please provide me a list of patients associated with the payer with the ID df166300-5a78-3502-a46a-832842197811.'

To answer this question, we need to join the `patients` table with the `claims` table, and then join the `claims` table with the `payers` table, as the payer ID is associated with the claims, and the claims are associated with the patients.

Here's the correct SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT p.first, p.last 
FROM patients p 
LEFT JOIN claims cl ON p.id = cl.patientid 
LEFT JOIN payers py ON cl.payerid = py.id 
WHERE py.id = 'df166300-5a78-3502-a46a-832842197811';

This query will provide a list of patients associated with the payer having the ID `df166300-5a78-3502-a46a-832842197811`.",6.1932761669158936

LEFT JOIN observation_codes oc ON o.codeid = oc.id 
WHERE oc.code = 'Body mass index (BMI) [Percentile]' AND oc.category = 'Per age and sex';
```

Here's how I constructed the query:

* I assumed there are three tables: `patients`, `observations`, and `observation_codes`.
* I used the `LEFT JOIN` to connect the `observations` table with the `patients` table on the `patientid` foreign key, and then connected the `observations` table with the `observation_codes` table on the `codeid` foreign key.
* I selected the `first` and `last` columns from the `patients` table, and the `value` and `unit` columns from the `observations` table.
* I used the `WHERE` clause to filter the results to only include observations with the code 'Body mass index (BMI) [Percentile]' and category 'Per age and sex'.
* I used `DISTINCT` to remove duplicate patient records.

Note that this query assumes the existence of the `code` and `category` columns in the `observation_codes` table, and the `value` and `unit` columns in the `observations` table. If these columns do not exist, the query will need to be modified accordingly.",4.577411413192749
What is the body site code of the imaging study with the ID 1253afc5-02e2-4d25-a878-6b1d7a8f2cc9?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT i.body_site_code FROM imaging_studies i WHERE i.id='1253afc5-02e2-4d25-a878-6b1d7a8f2cc9';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the body site code of the imaging study with a specific ID.
* Since the question only mentions the imaging study ID, we only need to query the `imaging_studies` table.
* We use the `SELECT DISTINCT` statement to retrieve the unique `body_site_code` value.
* We filter the results using the `WHERE` clause with the specific `id` value provided in the question.

Note that if the `imaging_studies` table has a foreign key referencing another table, and the question required joining with that table, I would use a `JOIN` statement accordingly. However, in this case, the question only requires information from the `imaging_studies` table.",6.137587070465088
What type of observation is Patient Health Questionnaire 2 item (PHQ-2) total score [Reported]?,"Based on the provided question, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query. Here's my answer:

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT o.type FROM observations o LEFT JOIN observation_types ot ON o.observation_type_id = ot.id WHERE ot.name='Patient Health Questionnaire 2 item (PHQ-2) total score' AND o.reported=true;

Here's my reasoning:

* The question asks about the type of observation, so I'm selecting the ""type"" column from the ""observations"" table.
* The question mentions ""Patient Health Questionnaire 2 item (PHQ-2) total score"", which is likely the name of an observation type. I'm joining the ""observations"" table with the ""observation_types"" table on the ""observation_type_id"" foreign key.
* The question asks about the type of observation, so I'm filtering the results to only include observations with the specified name.
* The question mentions ""Reported"", which is likely a boolean column in the ""observations"" table. I'm filtering the results to only include reported observations.

Note that I'm assuming the existence of the ""observation_types"" table and the ""reported"" column in the ""observations"" table. If these assumptions are incorrect, the query may need to be modified accordingly.",6.693852663040161
What is the reason code for the procedure of code 117015009?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'What is the reason code for the procedure of code 117015009?'

To answer this question, I'll assume there are two tables: `procedures` and `reason_codes`. The `procedures` table has columns `id` and `code`, and the `reason_codes` table has columns `id`, `procedure_id` (foreign key referencing `procedures.id`), and `reason_code`.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT rc.reason_code FROM procedures p JOIN reason_codes rc ON p.id = rc.procedure_id WHERE p.code = '117015009';

This query joins the `procedures` table with the `reason_codes` table on the `procedure_id` foreign key, and then filters the results to only include the row where the `code` column in the `procedures` table matches the given value '117015009'. The `SELECT` statement only retrieves the `reason_code` column from the `reason_codes` table.",5.235906600952148
Can you provide the count of patients suffering from the allergy with the code 264287008?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'Can you provide the count of patients suffering from the allergy with the code 264287008?'

To answer this question, I'll assume there are three tables: `patients`, `allergies`, and `patient_allergies`. The `patient_allergies` table is a junction table that connects `patients` and `allergies` through foreign keys.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT p.id) 
FROM patients p 
JOIN patient_allergies pa ON p.id = pa.patientid 
JOIN allergies a ON pa.allergyid = a.id 
WHERE a.code = '264287008';

This query joins the `patients` table with the `patient_allergies` table on the `patientid` foreign key, and then joins the `patient_allergies` table with the `allergies` table on the `allergyid` foreign key. It then filters the results to only include patients with an allergy code of '264287008' and finally counts the distinct patient IDs.",7.0519349575042725

[Q]: 'Please provide me the series UID of the imaging study with the ID 1253afc5-02e2-4d25-a878-6b1d7a8f2cc9.'

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT is.studyuid FROM imagingstudies is WHERE is.id='1253afc5-02e2-4d25-a878-6b1d7a8f2cc9';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the series UID of the imaging study with a specific ID.
* Since the question only mentions the imaging study ID, we only need to query the `imagingstudies` table.
* We use the `WHERE` clause to filter the results based on the provided ID.
* We use `SELECT DISTINCT` to ensure we get a unique result, as the question asks for a specific series UID.

Note: I assume the `imagingstudies` table has columns `id` and `studyuid`. If the column names are different, please adjust the query accordingly.",4.159548759460449
What is the start date of the care plan Lifestyle education regarding hypertension?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[SQL]: SELECT cp.start_date 
FROM care_plans cp 
JOIN care_plan_activities cpa ON cp.id = cpa.care_plan_id 
JOIN activities a ON cpa.activity_id = a.id 
WHERE a.name = 'Lifestyle education' AND cp.name = 'regarding hypertension';

Here's how I constructed the query:

1. I identified the relevant tables: `care_plans`, `care_plan_activities`, and `activities`.
2. I used the `JOIN` clause to connect the tables based on their foreign keys: `care_plan_id` in `care_plan_activities` references `id` in `care_plans`, and `activity_id` in `care_plan_activities` references `id` in `activities`.
3. I filtered the results using the `WHERE` clause to match the specific care plan name and activity name mentioned in the question.
4. I selected only the `start_date` column from the `care_plans` table, as it's the only relevant column for the question.

Note that I assumed the existence of the necessary tables and columns based on the provided notes and examples. If the actual database schema differs, the query may need to be adjusted accordingly.",6.660890340805054
Please provide me the encounters that are related to the device with code 706180003.,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the given question.

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT e.* 
FROM devices d 
JOIN encounters e ON d.id = e.deviceid 
WHERE d.code = '706180003';

Here's a brief explanation of the query:

* We start by selecting all columns (`*`) from the `encounters` table, but only the distinct ones to avoid duplicates.
* We join the `devices` table with the `encounters` table on the `deviceid` foreign key, which links a device to its corresponding encounters.
* We filter the results to only include encounters related to the device with the code `706180003` using the `WHERE` clause.

Note that I'm assuming the existence of a `deviceid` foreign key in the `encounters` table that references the `id` column in the `devices` table. If this is not the case, please provide more information about the table structure and relationships.",6.9857497215271
Who has been treated with the procedure of code 428211000124100?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'Who has been treated with the procedure of code 428211000124100?'

To answer this question, we need to join the `procedures` table with the `patients` table through the `claims` table, as a claim is associated with a patient and a procedure.

[SQL]: 
SELECT DISTINCT p.first, p.last 
FROM procedures pr 
JOIN claims cl ON pr.id = cl.procedureid 
JOIN patients p ON cl.patientid = p.id 
WHERE pr.code = '428211000124100';",6.273608207702637
How many medications are uncovered by the payer Cigna Health?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

Here's the answer:

[SQL]: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT m.id) 
FROM medications m 
JOIN claims cl ON m.claimid = cl.id 
JOIN payers p ON cl.payerid = p.id 
WHERE p.name = 'Cigna Health' AND m.covered = FALSE;

Explanation:

* We need to count the number of medications that are not covered by the payer Cigna Health.
* We join the `medications` table with the `claims` table on the `claimid` column, and then join the `claims` table with the `payers` table on the `payerid` column.
* We filter the results to only include medications where the payer is 'Cigna Health' and the medication is not covered (`m.covered = FALSE`).
* We use `COUNT(DISTINCT m.id)` to count the number of unique medications that meet the conditions.

Note: The assumption is that the `medications` table has a column `covered` that indicates whether the medication is covered or not, and the `payers` table has a column `name` that stores the payer's name. If the column names are different, the query should be adjusted accordingly.",2.9139604568481445
Please provide the reason code and description for the encounter 10a48862-79c6-036e-e572-f80160131cd0.,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT e.reason_code, e.description 
FROM encounters e 
WHERE e.id='10a48862-79c6-036e-e572-f80160131cd0';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the reason code and description for a specific encounter ID.
* Since the question only mentions the encounter ID, we only need to query the `encounters` table.
* We use the `WHERE` clause to filter the results for the specific encounter ID.
* We use `SELECT DISTINCT` to ensure we get unique results, although in this case, it's unlikely to have duplicate reason codes and descriptions for the same encounter ID.

Note: If the `reason_code` and `description` columns are not in the `encounters` table, we might need to join with another table. However, based on the provided information, it seems that these columns are part of the `encounters` table.",6.091238498687744
Please provide me the patients receiving aid under the care plan with code 735984001.,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'Please provide me the patients receiving aid under the care plan with code 735984001.'

To answer this question, we need to join the `patients`, `care_plans`, and `care_plan_codes` tables. We'll use the foreign keys to join these tables.

[SQL]: 
```
SELECT DISTINCT p.first, p.last 
FROM patients p 
LEFT JOIN care_plans cp ON p.id = cp.patientid 
LEFT JOIN care_plan_codes cpc ON cp.id = cpc.careplanid 
WHERE cpc.code = '735984001';
```

This query joins the `patients` table with the `care_plans` table on the `patientid` column, and then joins the result with the `care_plan_codes` table on the `careplanid` column. The `WHERE` clause filters the results to only include care plans with the code `735984001`. The `SELECT DISTINCT` statement ensures that we get unique patient names.",5.5309202671051025

[SQL]: SELECT p.city FROM providers p WHERE p.id='4c47cd08-3f26-3128-9740-1113ee0ccc80';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the city of the provider with a specific ID, so we only need to query the `providers` table.
* We use the `WHERE` clause to filter the results based on the provider ID.
* Since we only need the city, we only select the `city` column.

Note: Assuming the `providers` table has an `id` column and a `city` column. If the table structure is different, the query might need to be adjusted accordingly.",5.38147497177124

When did the allergy with the code 419199007 stop?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'When did the allergy with the code 419199007 stop?'

To answer this question, I'll assume there are two tables: `allergies` and `allergy_history`. The `allergies` table has columns `id`, `code`, and `patientid`, and the `allergy_history` table has columns `id`, `allergyid`, `stop_date`, and `patientid`. The foreign key is `allergyid` in the `allergy_history` table, which references the `id` column in the `allergies` table.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT ah.stop_date FROM allergies a JOIN allergy_history ah ON a.id = ah.allergyid WHERE a.code = '419199007' ORDER BY ah.stop_date DESC LIMIT 1;

This query joins the `allergies` and `allergy_history` tables on the `allergyid` foreign key, filters the results to only include the allergy with code `419199007`, and then selects the most recent `stop_date` using the `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT 1` clauses.",5.209273099899292

Assuming there are two tables: `medications` and `prices`. The `medications` table has columns `id`, `name`, and `dosage`, and the `prices` table has columns `id`, `medication_id` (foreign key referencing `medications.id`), and `cost`.

Here's the SQL query:

```
SELECT p.cost 
FROM medications m 
JOIN prices p ON m.id = p.medication_id 
WHERE m.name = 'amLODIPine' AND m.dosage = '2.5 MG Oral Tablet';
```

This query joins the `medications` and `prices` tables on the `medication_id` foreign key, and then filters the results to only include the medication with the specified name and dosage, returning the corresponding cost.",5.461634159088135
Please provide me the number of immunizations uncovered by the payer Medicare.,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[SQL]: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT i.id) 
FROM immunizations i 
JOIN claims cl ON i.claimid = cl.id 
JOIN payers p ON cl.payerid = p.id 
WHERE p.name='Medicare';

Explanation:

* We need to count the number of immunizations, so we use the `COUNT(DISTINCT i.id)` aggregation function.
* We join the `immunizations` table with the `claims` table on the `claimid` foreign key.
* We then join the `claims` table with the `payers` table on the `payerid` foreign key.
* We filter the results to only include immunizations where the payer is 'Medicare'.

Note: Assuming the table and column names are correct, if the schema is different, the query might need to be adjusted accordingly.",5.0675950050354
On which date was the allergy House dust mite (organism) recorded?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

Assuming there are two tables: `allergies` and `patients`, where `allergies` has columns `id`, `patientid`, `allergen`, and `recorded_date`, and `patients` has columns `id`, `first`, and `last`.

Here's the SQL query:

```
SELECT DISTINCT a.recorded_date 
FROM allergies a 
WHERE a.allergen='House dust mite (organism)';
```

This query selects the distinct `recorded_date` from the `allergies` table where the `allergen` is 'House dust mite (organism)'. Since the question only asks for the date, we don't need to join the `patients` table.",5.049981594085693
What is the address of the provider named Jacque955 Streich926?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[SQL]: SELECT p.address FROM providers p WHERE p.first='Jacque955' AND p.last='Streich926';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the address of a specific provider, so we only need to query the `providers` table.
* We use the `WHERE` clause to filter the results based on the provider's first and last names, which are 'Jacque955' and 'Streich926', respectively.
* Since we only need the address, we select only the `address` column from the `providers` table.

Note: If the provider's name is not unique, we might need to use additional columns to identify the correct provider. However, based on the given input, this query should provide the correct answer.",5.979748487472534

When did the allergy with the code 264287008 stop?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[SQL]: SELECT MAX(stop) FROM allergies a LEFT JOIN patients p ON a.patientid = p.id WHERE a.code = '264287008';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks when the allergy with the code 264287008 stopped, so we need to query the `allergies` table.
* We assume that the `allergies` table has a column `stop` that represents the date when the allergy stopped.
* We also assume that the `allergies` table has a foreign key `patientid` that references the `id` column in the `patients` table, so we use a LEFT JOIN to link the two tables.
* We filter the results to only include the allergy with the code '264287008' using the `WHERE` clause.
* Since we want to know when the allergy stopped, we use the `MAX` aggregation function to get the latest stop date.

Note that this query assumes the existence of the `stop` column in the `allergies` table and the foreign key relationship between the `allergies` and `patients` tables. If these assumptions are incorrect, the query may need to be modified accordingly.",5.2144622802734375
Please provide me the number of encounters covered by the payer NO_INSURANCE.,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

FROM encounters e 
JOIN claims c ON e.claimid = c.id 
JOIN payers p ON c.payerid = p.id 
WHERE p.name = 'NO_INSURANCE';

Here's a brief explanation of the query:

* We need to count the number of encounters, so we use the `COUNT(DISTINCT e.id)` aggregation function.
* We join the `encounters` table with the `claims` table on the `claimid` foreign key.
* We then join the `claims` table with the `payers` table on the `payerid` foreign key.
* We filter the results to only include encounters covered by the payer 'NO_INSURANCE' using the `WHERE` clause.

Note that I assumed the existence of the following tables and columns:

* `encounters` table with an `id` column and a `claimid` foreign key.
* `claims` table with an `id` column and a `payerid` foreign key.
* `payers` table with an `id` column and a `name` column.

If the actual table and column names differ, the query may need to be adjusted accordingly.",5.275891542434692

Please provide me the encounters that were related to the supply with the code 972002.,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT e.* 
FROM encounters e 
JOIN supplies s ON e.supplyid = s.id 
WHERE s.code = '972002';

Here's a brief explanation of the query:

* We're selecting all columns (`*`) from the `encounters` table (`e`), as the question asks for the encounters.
* We're joining the `encounters` table with the `supplies` table on the `supplyid` column, which is the foreign key that links an encounter to a supply.
* We're filtering the results to only include encounters related to the supply with the code `972002`, as specified in the question.

Note that I'm assuming the existence of a `supplyid` column in the `encounters` table, which is a foreign key referencing the `id` column in the `supplies` table. If this assumption is incorrect, please provide more information about the table schema.",5.060750484466553

Note that I'm assuming the existence of the `allergies` and `substances` tables, as well as the `recorded_date` and `substance_id` columns, based on the provided notes and examples. If the actual table and column names differ, the query would need to be adjusted accordingly.",6.187994480133057
What is the date of the record for the allergy with the code 29046?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'What is the date of the record for the allergy with the code 29046?'

To answer this question, I'll assume there are two tables: `allergies` and `records`. The `allergies` table has columns `id`, `code`, and `record_id`, and the `records` table has columns `id` and `date`.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT r.date FROM allergies a JOIN records r ON a.record_id = r.id WHERE a.code = 29046;

This query joins the `allergies` table with the `records` table on the `record_id` foreign key, and then filters the results to only include the record with the allergy code 29046. The `SELECT` statement only retrieves the `date` column from the `records` table.",5.026119709014893
Please provide me the patients with the condition Viral sinusitis (disorder).,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'Please provide me the patients with the condition Viral sinusitis (disorder).'

To answer this question, I'll assume there are three tables: `patients`, `conditions`, and `patient_conditions`. The `patient_conditions` table is a junction table that connects patients with conditions.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: 
SELECT DISTINCT p.first, p.last 
FROM patients p 
JOIN patient_conditions pc ON p.id = pc.patientid 
JOIN conditions c ON pc.conditionid = c.id 
WHERE c.name = 'Viral sinusitis (disorder)';

This query joins the `patients` table with the `patient_conditions` table on the `patientid` foreign key, and then joins the `patient_conditions` table with the `conditions` table on the `conditionid` foreign key. The `WHERE` clause filters the results to only include patients with the condition 'Viral sinusitis (disorder)'. The `SELECT DISTINCT` statement ensures that each patient is only listed once, even if they have multiple records with the same condition.",6.2867271900177

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT cp.startdate FROM care_plans cp LEFT JOIN care_plan_codes cpc ON cp.id = cpc.careplanid WHERE cpc.code = '736376001';

Here's the explanation:

* We need to find the care plan with the code 736376001, so we start by joining the `care_plans` table with the `care_plan_codes` table on the `careplanid` foreign key.
* We filter the results to only include the care plan with the code 736376001 using the `WHERE` clause.
* We select the `startdate` column from the `care_plans` table, which represents when the care plan was used.
* We use `DISTINCT` to remove any duplicate start dates, in case the same care plan was used multiple times.

Note that this query assumes the existence of the `care_plans` and `care_plan_codes` tables, as well as the `startdate` and `code` columns, respectively. If these tables or columns do not exist, the query will not work as intended.",5.215071439743042

[Q]: 'Please provide me a list of patients associated with the payer with the ID d18ef2e6-ef40-324c-be54-34a5ee865625.'

To answer this question, we need to join the `patients` table with the `claims` table, and then join the `claims` table with the `payers` table, as the payer ID is associated with the claims, and the claims are associated with the patients.

Here's the correct SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT p.first, p.last 
FROM patients p 
LEFT JOIN claims cl ON p.id = cl.patientid 
LEFT JOIN payers py ON cl.payerid = py.id 
WHERE py.id = 'd18ef2e6-ef40-324c-be54-34a5ee865625';

```
SELECT SUM(DATE_PART('month', AGE(m.end_date, m.start_date))) AS total_months
FROM memberships m
JOIN payers p ON m.payer_id = p.id
WHERE p.id = 'd18ef2e6-ef40-324c-be54-34a5ee865625';
```

This query joins the `memberships` table with the `payers` table on the `payer_id` foreign key. It then filters the results to only include the payer with the specified ID. The `DATE_PART` function is used to calculate the difference in months between the `end_date` and `start_date` for each membership, and the `SUM` aggregation function is used to calculate the total number of months.",6.364736795425415
Who had the allergy Mold (organism)?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'Who had the allergy Mold (organism)?'

To answer this question, we need to join the `patients` table with the `allergies` table, as the allergy information is stored in the `allergies` table, and we want to retrieve the patient information.

Assuming the `allergies` table has columns `id`, `patientid`, and `allergen`, and the `patients` table has columns `id`, `first`, and `last`, the correct SQL query would be:

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT p.first, p.last FROM allergies a LEFT JOIN patients p ON a.patientid = p.id WHERE a.allergen = 'Mold (organism)';

This query joins the `allergies` table with the `patients` table on the `patientid` column, filters the results to only include rows where the `allergen` is 'Mold (organism)', and selects the distinct `first` and `last` names of the patients who have this allergy.",7.145343065261841

To answer this question, we need to join the `observations` table with the `encounters` table. Assuming there is a foreign key `encounterid` in the `observations` table that references the `id` column in the `encounters` table, we can write the following query:

[SQL]: 
SELECT e.id, e.date 
FROM observations o 
JOIN encounters e ON o.encounterid = e.id 
WHERE o.code = '21000-5';

This query will return the `id` and `date` of the encounter associated with the observation having the code '21000-5'.",5.063678979873657

[Q]: Please provide me the patients with the care plan Routine antenatal care.

To answer this question, I'll assume there are three tables: patients, care_plans, and patient_care_plans. The patient_care_plans table is a junction table that connects patients and care plans.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: 
SELECT DISTINCT p.first, p.last 
FROM patients p 
LEFT JOIN patient_care_plans pcp ON p.id = pcp.patientid 
LEFT JOIN care_plans cp ON pcp.careplanid = cp.id 
WHERE cp.name = 'Routine antenatal care';

This query joins the patients table with the patient_care_plans table on the patientid column, and then joins the patient_care_plans table with the care_plans table on the careplanid column. The WHERE clause filters the results to only include patients with the care plan 'Routine antenatal care'. The SELECT statement retrieves the first and last names of these patients.",5.124968528747559

What is the start date of the procedure Assessment of substance use (procedure)?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'What is the start date of the procedure Assessment of substance use (procedure)?'

To answer this question, I'll assume there are two tables: `procedures` and `procedure_instances`. The `procedures` table contains information about the procedures, and the `procedure_instances` table contains information about the instances of those procedures.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT pi.start_date FROM procedures p INNER JOIN procedure_instances pi ON p.id = pi.procedure_id WHERE p.name = 'Assessment of substance use';

This query joins the `procedures` table with the `procedure_instances` table on the `procedure_id` foreign key. It then selects the `start_date` column from the `procedure_instances` table where the `name` column in the `procedures` table matches 'Assessment of substance use'.",4.0188562870025635
What is the total cost of the medication Acetaminophen 300 MG / Hydrocodone Bitartrate 5 MG Oral Tablet?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

Assuming we have the following tables:

* `medications` with columns `id`, `name`, and `cost`

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the start date of medication with a specific code, so we only need to query the `medications` table.
* We use the `WHERE` clause to filter the results to only include the medication with the code `312961`.
* Since we're only interested in the start date, we only select the `start_date` column.

Note: If the `medications` table has a foreign key to another table, and the question required joining with that table, I would use a `JOIN` clause accordingly. However, based on the provided information, it seems that the `medications` table has the necessary information to answer the question.",5.0165979862213135

Here's the answer:

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT e.* FROM conditions c 
JOIN encounters e ON c.encounterid = e.id 
WHERE c.code = '105531004';

Explanation:

* We need to query the `conditions` table to filter by the condition code '105531004'.
* Since we want to retrieve the related encounters, we need to join the `conditions` table with the `encounters` table using the `encounterid` foreign key.
* We use `SELECT DISTINCT` to ensure we get unique encounter records.
* We use `e.*` to retrieve all columns from the `encounters` table, as the question doesn't specify which columns are required.

* We use the `WHERE` clause to filter the results based on the procedure code '225158009'.
* Since we want to retrieve all columns from the `encounters` table, we use `e.*` in the `SELECT` statement.
* We use `DISTINCT` to remove any duplicate encounters, if any.",4.154289960861206
When was the care plan Wound care used?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

Since the question asks ""When was the care plan Wound care used?"", I'll assume there are two tables: `care_plans` and `encounters`. The `care_plans` table has a column `name` with the value 'Wound care', and the `encounters` table has a column `care_plan_id` that references the `id` column in the `care_plans` table. The `encounters` table also has a column `date` that represents when the care plan was used.

Here's the SQL query:

```
SELECT DISTINCT e.date 
FROM care_plans cp 
JOIN encounters e ON cp.id = e.care_plan_id 
WHERE cp.name = 'Wound care' 
ORDER BY e.date DESC;

Please provide me the number of procedures covered by the payer Medicaid.,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

Here's the answer:

[SQL]: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT p.id) 
FROM procedures p 
JOIN payers py ON p.payerid = py.id 
WHERE py.name='Medicaid';

Explanation:

* We need to count the number of procedures covered by the payer Medicaid, so we use the `COUNT(DISTINCT p.id)` function to get the unique count of procedures.
* We join the `procedures` table with the `payers` table on the `payerid` foreign key to link each procedure to its corresponding payer.
* We filter the results to only include procedures where the payer's name is 'Medicaid'.

Note: Assuming the `procedures` table has a column `id` and a foreign key `payerid` referencing the `id` column in the `payers` table, and the `payers` table has a column `name`. If the column names are different, please adjust the query accordingly.",5.07843017578125
Please provide me the encounters that are related to the condition Metabolic syndrome X (disorder).,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the given question.

Here's the query:

```
SELECT DISTINCT e.id, e.date, e.description 
FROM encounters e 
JOIN conditions c ON e.id = c.encounterid 
JOIN codings co ON c.id = co.conditionid 
JOIN codes cd ON co.codeid = cd.id 
WHERE cd.name = 'Metabolic syndrome X (disorder)';
```

Here's how I arrived at this query:

* The question asks for encounters related to a specific condition, so we need to join the `encounters` table with the `conditions` table using the `encounterid` foreign key.
* The `conditions` table is then joined with the `codings` table using the `conditionid` foreign key.
* The `codings` table is joined with the `codes` table using the `codeid` foreign key.
* Finally, we filter the results to only include encounters related to the condition 'Metabolic syndrome X (disorder)' by specifying the `name` column in the `codes` table.

Note that I've used `DISTINCT` to remove duplicate encounters, and I've only selected the relevant columns (`id`, `date`, and `description`) from the `encounters` table.",5.227384567260742

* We also need to join the `codes` table with the `allergies` table using the `codeid` foreign key to filter the specific code '264287008'.
* We use `SELECT DISTINCT` to remove duplicates and `*` to retrieve all columns from the `encounters` table.
* The `WHERE` clause filters the results to only include encounters related to the allergy with the code '264287008'.",5.087782144546509
When was the imaging study with the ID fcbd803f-8ac1-a6fb-1ea8-aa71925db967 conducted?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[SQL]: SELECT study_date FROM imaging_studies WHERE id='fcbd803f-8ac1-a6fb-1ea8-aa71925db967';

Here's my reasoning:

* The question asks for the date when the imaging study with a specific ID was conducted.
* Since the question provides the ID of the imaging study, we can directly query the `imaging_studies` table.
* We only need to retrieve the `study_date` column, so we select only that column.
* We use the `WHERE` clause to filter the results to the specific imaging study with the given ID.

Note: I assume that the `imaging_studies` table has a column named `study_date` that stores the date when the imaging study was conducted, and an `id` column that matches the provided ID. If the column names or table structure are different, the query may need to be adjusted accordingly.",6.154816150665283

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT p.first, p.last 
FROM conditions c 
JOIN patients p ON c.patientid = p.id 
WHERE c.code = '241929008';

Here's the explanation:

* We need to query the `conditions` table to find the condition with code `241929008`.
* Since we want to retrieve the patients with this condition, we need to join the `conditions` table with the `patients` table using the `patientid` foreign key.
* We use `SELECT DISTINCT` to retrieve unique patient names.
* We only select the `first` and `last` columns from the `patients` table, as they are the relevant columns for this question.",5.194005489349365
What is the cost of the immunization Td (adult)  5 Lf tetanus toxoid  preservative free  adsorbed?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

Assuming there are two tables: `immunizations` and `prices`. The `immunizations` table has columns `id`, `name`, and `description`, and the `prices` table has columns `id`, `immunization_id` (foreign key referencing `immunizations.id`), and `cost`.

Here's the SQL query:

```
SELECT p.cost 
FROM immunizations i 
JOIN prices p ON i.id = p.immunization_id 
WHERE i.name = 'Td (adult)' AND i.description = '5 Lf tetanus toxoid preservative free adsorbed';
```

This query joins the `immunizations` and `prices` tables on the `immunization_id` foreign key, and then filters the results to find the cost of the specific immunization 'Td (adult) 5 Lf tetanus toxoid preservative free adsorbed'.",5.05007004737854
What is the name of the supply with the code 337388004?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'What is the name of the supply with the code 337388004?'

[SQL]: SELECT s.name FROM supplies s WHERE s.code='337388004';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the name of the supply with a specific code, so we only need to query the `supplies` table.
* We use the `WHERE` clause to filter the results based on the provided code.
* Since we only need the name of the supply, we only select the `name` column.

Note: Assuming the `code` column is unique in the `supplies` table, we don't need to use `DISTINCT` in this case. If the `code` column is not unique, and you want to retrieve all supply names with the given code, you can remove the `DISTINCT` keyword.",6.459214448928833
What is the gender of the provider named Gustavo235 Armstrong51?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[SQL]: SELECT p.gender FROM providers p WHERE p.first='Gustavo235' AND p.last='Armstrong51';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the gender of a specific provider, so we only need to query the `providers` table.
* We use the `WHERE` clause to filter the results based on the provider's first and last names, which are 'Gustavo235' and 'Armstrong51', respectively.
* Since we only need the gender of the provider, we only select the `gender` column.

Note: If the provider's name is not unique, this query might return multiple results. If you want to ensure a single result, you might need to add additional filters or constraints.",5.368950128555298
Which patient had the allergy with the code 782576004?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'Which patient had the allergy with the code 782576004?'

To answer this question, we need to join the `patients` table with the `allergies` table, as the allergy code is stored in the `allergies` table, and we want to retrieve the patient information.

[SQL]: 
```
SELECT DISTINCT p.first, p.last 
FROM allergies a 
LEFT JOIN patients p ON a.patientid = p.id 
WHERE a.code = '782576004';
```

This query joins the `allergies` table with the `patients` table on the `patientid` foreign key, and then filters the results to only include the patient(s) with the allergy code `782576004`. The `DISTINCT` keyword is used to ensure we only get unique patient names.",4.595904111862183
What is the SNOMED code for the allergy described as Aspirin?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'What is the SNOMED code for the allergy described as Aspirin?'

To answer this question, I'll assume there are two tables: `allergies` and `codes`. The `allergies` table has columns `id`, `description`, and `code_id`, and the `codes` table has columns `id` and `snomed_code`.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT c.snomed_code FROM allergies a JOIN codes c ON a.code_id = c.id WHERE a.description = 'Aspirin';

This query joins the `allergies` table with the `codes` table on the `code_id` foreign key, and then selects the `snomed_code` column from the `codes` table where the `description` column in the `allergies` table matches 'Aspirin'.",5.065209627151489

Can you tell me when the allergy with the code 29046 was recorded?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[SQL]: SELECT a.recorded_date FROM allergies a LEFT JOIN patients p ON a.patientid = p.id WHERE a.code = '29046';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the recorded date of the allergy with the code 29046.
* We need to query the `allergies` table, which likely has a column for the recorded date and the allergy code.
* Since the question doesn't mention a specific patient, we don't need to join with the `patients` table. However, I've included the join in case the `allergies` table has a foreign key referencing the `patients` table.
* We use the `WHERE` clause to filter the results to only include the allergy with the code 29046.
* We select only the `recorded_date` column, as that's the information requested in the question.",4.041125535964966
What is the average tenure of employees in different departments?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

Assuming we have two tables: `employees` and `departments`. The `employees` table has columns `id`, `department_id`, `hire_date`, and the `departments` table has columns `id`, `name`.

Here's the SQL query:

```
SELECT d.name, AVG(DATE_PART('year', AGE(CURRENT_DATE, e.hire_date))) AS avg_tenure
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.id
GROUP BY d.name
ORDER BY avg_tenure DESC;
```

This query joins the `employees` table with the `departments` table on the `department_id` foreign key. It then calculates the average tenure for each department using the `AVG` and `DATE_PART` functions, and groups the results by department name. Finally, it sorts the results in descending order by average tenure.",5.0154807567596436

What is the successrate of medication 24 HR Metformin hydrochloride 500 MG Extended Release Oral Tablet?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

Here's the query:

```
SELECT 
  m.medication, 
  ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN o.outcome = 'Success' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(o.outcome) * 100, 2) AS success_rate
FROM 
  outcomes o 
  JOIN treatments t ON o.treatmentid = t.id 
  JOIN medications m ON t.medicationid = m.id 
WHERE 
  m.medication = '24 HR Metformin hydrochloride 500 MG Extended Release Oral Tablet' 
GROUP BY 
  m.medication;
```

Here's how I arrived at this query:

* The question asks for the success rate of a specific medication, so we need to join the `medications` table with other relevant tables.
* We need to count the number of successful outcomes for this medication, so we join the `outcomes` table.
* The `treatments` table is likely the bridge table between `medications` and `outcomes`, so we join that as well.
* We use a `CASE` statement to count only the successful outcomes.
* We use the `ROUND` function to calculate the success rate as a percentage with two decimal places.
* We group the result by the medication name to get the success rate for the specific medication.

Note that this query assumes the existence of the following tables and columns:

* `medications` table with a `medication` column
* `treatments` table with `id` and `medicationid` columns
* `outcomes` table with `id`, `treatmentid`, and `outcome` columns

If these assumptions are incorrect, the query may need to be adjusted accordingly.",4.539989233016968
What is the reason for using the care plan with code 134435003?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'What is the reason for using the care plan with code 134435003?'

To answer this question, I'll assume there are two tables: `care_plans` and `care_plan_reasons`. The `care_plans` table has columns `id`, `code`, and `care_plan_id`, and the `care_plan_reasons` table has columns `id`, `care_plan_id`, and `reason`.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT cpr.reason FROM care_plans cp INNER JOIN care_plan_reasons cpr ON cp.id = cpr.care_plan_id WHERE cp.code = '134435003';

This query joins the `care_plans` table with the `care_plan_reasons` table on the `care_plan_id` foreign key, and then selects the `reason` column from the `care_plan_reasons` table where the `code` column in the `care_plans` table matches the given code '134435003'.",8.982794046401978
How many medications are uncovered by the payer Dual Eligible?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

Here's the query:

```
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT m.id) 
FROM medications m 
JOIN claims cl ON m.claimid = cl.id 
JOIN payers p ON cl.payerid = p.id 
WHERE p.name = 'Dual Eligible' AND m.covered = FALSE;
```

Explanation:

* We need to count the number of medications that are uncovered by the payer 'Dual Eligible'.
* We join the `medications` table with the `claims` table on the `claimid` column, and then join the `claims` table with the `payers` table on the `payerid` column.
* We filter the results to only include medications where the payer is 'Dual Eligible' and the medication is not covered (`m.covered = FALSE`).
* We use `COUNT(DISTINCT m.id)` to count the number of unique medications that meet the conditions.

Note: This query assumes that the `medications` table has a column `covered` that indicates whether the medication is covered or not, and that the `payers` table has a column `name` that contains the payer name. If the column names are different, the query should be adjusted accordingly.",3.2345383167266846

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT i.modality_code FROM imaging_studies i WHERE i.id='8ce0d83f-9db0-dfd2-d1d2-5f7b9b20effa';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the modality code of the imaging study with a specific ID.
* Since the question only mentions the imaging study ID, we only need to query the `imaging_studies` table.
* We use the `SELECT DISTINCT` statement to retrieve the unique modality code for the specified imaging study ID.
* The `WHERE` clause filters the results to only include the imaging study with the ID `8ce0d83f-9db0-dfd2-d1d2-5f7b9b20effa`.",6.478008985519409

LEFT JOIN procedures pt ON cl.procedureid = pt.id 
WHERE cl.id='2ad4f44e-6c3e-45ab-53e4-2dcda6cdab87';

Here's the explanation:

* We need to query the `procedures` table to get the `procedure_code`.
* We need to join the `claims` table with the `procedures` table using the `procedureid` foreign key.
* We filter the results using the `WHERE` clause to only consider the claim transaction with the specified ID.
* We use `DISTINCT` to remove any duplicates, although in this case, it's unlikely to have duplicates since we're querying a specific claim ID.",5.140886068344116

[SQL]: SELECT e.snomed_code FROM encounters e WHERE e.id='b874f166-c96d-4e6c-8075-9b1a948a3df9';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the SNOMED code of a specific encounter with the ID 'b874f166-c96d-4e6c-8075-9b1a948a3df9'.
* Since the question only mentions the encounter ID, we can directly query the 'encounters' table.
* We only need to retrieve the 'snomed_code' column, so we specify that in the SELECT statement.
* We use the WHERE clause to filter the results based on the provided encounter ID.

Note: Assuming the 'encounters' table has a column named 'snomed_code' and 'id' which is the primary key. If the column names are different, please adjust the query accordingly.",6.080986738204956

SELECT d.name, AVG(DATE_PART('year', AGE(CURRENT_DATE, e.hire_date))) AS avg_tenure
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.id
GROUP BY d.name
ORDER BY avg_tenure DESC;
```

This query joins the `employees` table with the `departments` table on the `department_id` foreign key. It then calculates the average tenure for each department using the `AVG` and `DATE_PART` functions, and groups the results by department name. Finally, it sorts the results in descending order by average tenure.",5.029231309890747

[Q]: 'How many patients have or had the allergy with the code 264287008?'

To answer this question, we need to join the `patients` table with the `allergies` table, as the allergy code is stored in the `allergies` table, and we want to count the number of patients who have or had this allergy.

[SQL]: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT p.id) FROM patients p LEFT JOIN allergies a ON p.id = a.patientid WHERE a.code = '264287008';

Here's a brief explanation of the query:

* We use a `LEFT JOIN` to ensure that we include all patients, even if they don't have an allergy with the specified code.
* We join the `patients` table with the `allergies` table on the `patientid` foreign key.
* We filter the results to only include rows where the `code` column in the `allergies` table matches the specified code (`264287008`).
* We use `COUNT(DISTINCT p.id)` to count the number of unique patients who have or had this allergy.

Please provide me the encounters that were related to the procedure with code 274031008.,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the given question.

Here's the answer:

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT e.* FROM procedures p 
JOIN encounters e ON p.encounterid = e.id 
WHERE p.code = '274031008';

Explanation:

* We need to query the `encounters` table to get the relevant encounters.
* Since the question mentions a specific procedure code, we need to join the `procedures` table with the `encounters` table using the `encounterid` foreign key.
* We use the `WHERE` clause to filter the results based on the procedure code '274031008'.
* We use `SELECT DISTINCT` to ensure we get unique encounter records.

Note: Assuming the `procedures` table has a column named `code` and the `encounters` table has a primary key column named `id`. Also, assuming the foreign key in the `procedures` table is named `encounterid` which references the `id` column in the `encounters` table.",6.441414833068848

[SQL]: SELECT SUM(m.cost) AS total_cost 
FROM medications m 
JOIN medication_claims mc ON m.id = mc.medicationid 
WHERE m.name = 'Nitroglycerin 0.4 MG/ACTUAT Mucosal Spray';

Explanation:

* We need to find the total cost of the medication 'Nitroglycerin 0.4 MG/ACTUAT Mucosal Spray', so we'll query the `medications` table.
* Since we need the total cost, we'll use the `SUM` aggregation function.
* We'll join the `medications` table with the `medication_claims` table using the `medicationid` foreign key to get the cost of the medication.
* We'll filter the results using the `WHERE` clause to only consider the specific medication 'Nitroglycerin 0.4 MG/ACTUAT Mucosal Spray'.

What is the encounter associated with the condition with code 72892002?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'What is the encounter associated with the condition with code 72892002?'

To answer this question, we need to join the `conditions` table with the `encounters` table. Assuming there is a foreign key `encounterid` in the `conditions` table that references the `id` column in the `encounters` table, we can write the following query:

[SQL]: 
SELECT DISTINCT e.id, e.date 
FROM conditions c 
JOIN encounters e ON c.encounterid = e.id 
WHERE c.code = '72892002';

This query joins the `conditions` table with the `encounters` table on the `encounterid` foreign key, and then filters the results to only include the encounter associated with the condition having code '72892002'. The `SELECT` statement only retrieves the `id` and `date` columns from the `encounters` table, which are relevant to the question.",5.198954105377197

JOIN encounters e ON d.id = e.deviceid 
WHERE d.code = '337414009';

Here's a brief explanation of the query:

* We start by selecting all columns (`*`) from the `encounters` table, which is aliased as `e`.
* We join the `devices` table, aliased as `d`, with the `encounters` table on the condition that the `id` column in `devices` matches the `deviceid` column in `encounters`. This is based on the assumption that there is a foreign key relationship between the two tables.
* We filter the results to only include encounters related to the device with the code `337414009` using the `WHERE` clause.

Note that I'm assuming the existence of a foreign key relationship between the `devices` and `encounters` tables, and that the `deviceid` column in `encounters` references the `id` column in `devices`. If this is not the case, the query may need to be adjusted accordingly.",6.1780383586883545

How many patients have or had the allergy with the code 419199007?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'How many patients have or had the allergy with the code 419199007?'

To answer this question, we need to join the `patients` table with the `allergies` table, as the allergy code is stored in the `allergies` table, and we want to count the number of patients who have or had this allergy.

[SQL]: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT p.id) FROM patients p LEFT JOIN allergies a ON p.id = a.patientid WHERE a.code = '419199007';

Here's a brief explanation of the query:

* We use a `LEFT JOIN` to ensure that we include all patients, even if they don't have an allergy with the specified code.
* We join the `patients` table with the `allergies` table on the `patientid` foreign key.
* We filter the results to only include rows where the `code` column in the `allergies` table matches the specified code '419199007'.
* We use `COUNT(DISTINCT p.id)` to count the number of unique patients who have or had this allergy.

Note that we use `COUNT(DISTINCT p.id)` to avoid counting the same patient multiple times if they have multiple allergies with the same code.",5.253913640975952

WHERE py.id='0133f751-9229-3cfd-815f-b6d4979bdd6a' AND c.covered=false;

Here's the explanation:

* We need to count the number of procedures that are uncovered by the payer with the ID 0133f751-9229-3cfd-815f-b6d4979bdd6a.
* We start by selecting from the `procedures` table, as we're interested in counting procedures.
* We join the `claims` table on the `claimid` foreign key, as claims are related to procedures.
* We then join the `payers` table on the `payerid` foreign key, as payers are related to claims.
* We filter the results to only include claims that are not covered (`c.covered=false`) and belong to the payer with the specified ID.
* Finally, we use `COUNT(DISTINCT p.id)` to count the number of unique procedures that meet the conditions.",6.242712020874023

[Q]: 'Please provide me the department id of the claim with ID 0e303a4f-8ccd-6c27-ad49-b90b2712845c.'

[SQL]: SELECT d.id FROM claims cl LEFT JOIN departments d ON cl.departmentid = d.id WHERE cl.id='0e303a4f-8ccd-6c27-ad49-b90b2712845c';

Here's the explanation:

* We need to retrieve the department id, so we select `d.id` from the `departments` table.
* The question mentions the claim ID, so we need to join the `claims` table with the `departments` table using the `departmentid` foreign key.
* We filter the results using the `WHERE` clause to only include the claim with the specified ID.

Note that I assumed the existence of a `departmentid` column in the `claims` table and an `id` column in the `departments` table, which is a common convention in database design. If the actual column names differ, the query would need to be adjusted accordingly.",6.210740804672241
Please provide me the udi code related to the device Home continuous positive airway pressure unit (physical object).,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'Please provide me the udi code related to the device Home continuous positive airway pressure unit (physical object).'

To answer this question, I'll assume there are two tables: `devices` and `udi_codes`. The `devices` table has columns `id` and `name`, and the `udi_codes` table has columns `id`, `udi_code`, and `device_id` (which is a foreign key referencing the `id` column in the `devices` table).

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT uc.udi_code FROM devices d LEFT JOIN udi_codes uc ON d.id = uc.device_id WHERE d.name = 'Home continuous positive airway pressure unit';

This query joins the `devices` table with the `udi_codes` table on the `device_id` foreign key, and then filters the results to only include the row where the `name` column in the `devices` table matches the specified device name. The `SELECT DISTINCT` clause ensures that only unique `udi_code` values are returned.",5.347417116165161

Here's the answer:

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT e.* 
FROM observations o 
JOIN encounters e ON o.encounterid = e.id 
WHERE o.code = '29463-7';

Explanation:

* We need to query the `observations` table to find the observation with the code `29463-7`.
* Since we want to retrieve the related encounters, we need to join the `observations` table with the `encounters` table using the `encounterid` foreign key.
* We use `SELECT DISTINCT` to ensure we get unique encounter records.
* We use `e.*` to retrieve all columns from the `encounters` table.
* The `WHERE` clause filters the results to only include observations with the code `29463-7`.",4.958871364593506

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT c.stopdate 
FROM conditions c 
JOIN findings f ON c.findingid = f.id 
WHERE f.name = 'Limited social contact';

Here's the explanation:

* We need to query the `conditions` table to get the `stopdate`.
* Since the question mentions ""Limited social contact (finding)"", we need to join the `conditions` table with the `findings` table using the `findingid` foreign key.
* We filter the results to only include the condition with the name ""Limited social contact"" using the `WHERE` clause.
* We use `DISTINCT` to remove any duplicate `stopdate` values, if any.

Note: Assuming the table and column names are correct, if the question cannot be answered with the given input, I would respond with ""No answer possible based on given input"".",6.4638512134552
What is the start date of the care plan Lifestyle education regarding hypertension?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

JOIN care_plan_activities cpa ON cp.id = cpa.care_plan_id 
JOIN activities a ON cpa.activity_id = a.id 
WHERE a.name = 'Lifestyle education' AND cp.name = 'regarding hypertension';

Here's how I constructed the query:

1. I identified the relevant tables: `care_plans`, `care_plan_activities`, and `activities`.
2. I used the `JOIN` clause to connect the tables based on their foreign keys: `care_plan_id` in `care_plan_activities` references `id` in `care_plans`, and `activity_id` in `care_plan_activities` references `id` in `activities`.
3. I filtered the results using the `WHERE` clause to match the specific care plan name and activity name mentioned in the question.
4. I selected only the `start_date` column from the `care_plans` table, as it's the only relevant column for the question.

Note that I assumed the existence of the necessary tables and columns based on the provided notes and examples. If the actual database schema differs, the query may need to be adjusted accordingly.",4.23604679107666

What is the value of the observation with the code 39156-5?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT o.value FROM observations o WHERE o.code='39156-5';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the value of the observation with the code 39156-5, so we only need to query the `observations` table.
* We use the `DISTINCT` keyword to ensure we get unique values, although in this case, it's unlikely to have duplicate values for the same code.
* We select only the `value` column, as it's the only relevant column mentioned in the question.
* We filter the results using the `WHERE` clause with the condition `o.code='39156-5'`, which matches the code mentioned in the question.

Note that if the `observations` table has a foreign key referencing another table, and the question required joining with that table, I would use a `JOIN` clause accordingly. However, in this case, the question only requires querying the `observations` table.",4.576017379760742
Please provide me the provider associated with the claim transaction 9b243e0d-551a-65e5-0e1f-c52f3c4a3d72.,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'Please provide me the provider associated with the claim transaction 9b243e0d-551a-65e5-0e1f-c52f3c4a3d72.'

To answer this question, I'll assume there are three tables: `claims`, `providers`, and `claim_transactions`. The `claim_transactions` table has a foreign key `claim_id` referencing the `id` column in the `claims` table, and the `claims` table has a foreign key `provider_id` referencing the `id` column in the `providers` table.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: 
SELECT DISTINCT pr.first, pr.last 
FROM claim_transactions ct

This query joins the `claim_transactions` table with the `claims` table on the `claim_id` column, and then joins the resulting table with the `providers` table on the `provider_id` column. It then selects the distinct `first` and `last` names of the provider associated with the claim transaction having the specified ID.",6.689318656921387
Please provide me the series UID of the imaging study with the ID 735d7737-73ec-cbf9-ffef-9ef76bb31173.,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'Please provide me the series UID of the imaging study with the ID 735d7737-73ec-cbf9-ffef-9ef76bb31173.'

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT is.studyuid FROM imagingstudies is WHERE is.id='735d7737-73ec-cbf9-ffef-9ef76bb31173';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the series UID of the imaging study with a specific ID.
* Since the question mentions a specific ID, we can directly query the `imagingstudies` table.
* We use the `DISTINCT` keyword to ensure we get unique results, although in this case, it's unlikely to have duplicate series UIDs for the same imaging study ID.
* We select only the `studyuid` column, as it's the only relevant column mentioned in the question.
* We filter the results using the `WHERE` clause with the provided ID.

Note that I assume the `imagingstudies` table has an `id` column that matches the provided ID, and a `studyuid` column that contains the series UID. If the table structure is different, the query might need to be adjusted accordingly.",6.258695602416992

WHERE s.uid = '1.2.840.99999999.1.28327683.465192378676';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the modality description, so we only need to select that column.
* The question mentions the series UID, which is likely a unique identifier for the series table. We'll use this to filter the results.
* The modality description is likely a column in the imaging_studies table, so we'll join the series table with the imaging_studies table using the foreign key imaging_study_id.
* We use the DISTINCT keyword to ensure we get a unique result, even if there are multiple series with the same modality description.
* We use the WHERE clause to filter the results based on the provided series UID.",4.070221185684204
How long does Levora 0.15/30 28 Day Pack effect last?,"Based on the provided question, I will create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query. 

However, I need to make an assumption about the database schema and the tables involved. Let's assume we have two tables: `medications` and `effects`.

The `medications` table has columns `id`, `name`, and `dosage`, and the `effects` table has columns `id`, `medication_id` (foreign key referencing `medications.id`), and `duration`.

With this assumption, here is the SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT e.duration FROM medications m LEFT JOIN effects e ON m.id = e.medications_id WHERE m.name = 'Levora 0.15/30 28 Day Pack';

This query joins the `medications` table with the `effects` table on the `medication_id` foreign key, and then filters the results to only include the row where the medication name is 'Levora 0.15/30 28 Day Pack'. The `duration` column from the `effects` table is selected, which should provide the answer to the question.",6.144322633743286
Please provide me the number of encounters covered by the payer Anthem.,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

Here's the answer:

[SQL]: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT e.id) 
FROM encounters e 
JOIN payers p ON e.payerid = p.id 
WHERE p.name = 'Anthem';

Explanation:

* We need to count the number of encounters covered by the payer Anthem, so we'll use the `COUNT(DISTINCT e.id)` aggregation function to get the unique encounter IDs.
* We'll join the `encounters` table with the `payers` table on the `payerid` foreign key to link each encounter to its corresponding payer.
* We'll filter the results to only include encounters where the payer's name is 'Anthem' using the `WHERE` clause.

Note: Assuming the `encounters` table has a column `payerid` that references the `id` column in the `payers` table, and the `payers` table has a column `name` that stores the payer's name. If the column names or relationships are different, the query may need to be adjusted accordingly.",6.18006157875061

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT pr.reason FROM procedures pr LEFT JOIN procedure_codes pc ON pr.id = pc.procedureid WHERE pc.code = '710824005';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the reason for performing the procedure with a specific code, so we need to join the `procedures` table with the `procedure_codes` table.
* We use the `LEFT JOIN` to ensure that we get all procedures, even if there's no matching code.
* We use the `WHERE` clause to filter the results to only include the procedure with the code '710824005'.
* We use `DISTINCT` to remove any duplicate reasons, in case there are multiple procedures with the same reason.
* We only select the `reason` column from the `procedures` table, as that's the only column relevant to the question.",5.261687278747559

FROM encounters e 
JOIN organizations o ON e.organizationid = o.id 
WHERE o.id='dd3307db-114c-3f11-be44-a9eef6bb3fc5';

Here's a brief explanation of the query:

* We're selecting the `description` column from the `encounters` table, as that's what the question asks for.
* We're joining the `encounters` table with the `organizations` table on the `organizationid` foreign key, which links an encounter to an organization.
* We're filtering the results to only include encounters linked to the organization with the specific ID `dd3307db-114c-3f11-be44-a9eef6bb3fc5`.
* We're using `DISTINCT` to remove any duplicate descriptions, in case there are multiple encounters with the same description linked to the same organization.",5.205560207366943
What is the stop date of the procedure Assessment of anxiety (procedure)?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'What is the stop date of the procedure Assessment of anxiety (procedure)?'

To answer this question, I'll assume there are two tables: `procedures` and `procedure_instances`. The `procedures` table contains information about the procedures, and the `procedure_instances` table contains information about the instances of those procedures, including the stop date.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT pi.stop_date FROM procedures p INNER JOIN procedure_instances pi ON p.id = pi.procedure_id WHERE p.name = 'Assessment of anxiety';

This query joins the `procedures` table with the `procedure_instances` table on the `procedure_id` foreign key, and then filters the results to only include the procedure with the name 'Assessment of anxiety'. The `SELECT` statement only retrieves the `stop_date` column, which is the relevant information requested in the question.",6.5432350635528564

[SQL]: SELECT e.ethnicity FROM patients p LEFT JOIN ethnicity e ON p.ethnicityid = e.id WHERE p.first='Veum' AND p.last='823';

Here's how I constructed the query:

* I assumed there are two tables: `patients` and `ethnicity`.
* I used the `LEFT JOIN` to combine the two tables based on the foreign key `ethnicityid` in the `patients` table, which references the `id` column in the `ethnicity` table.
* I selected only the `ethnicity` column from the `ethnicity` table, as that's the information we're interested in.
* I used the `WHERE` clause to filter the results to only include the patient named 'Veum823'. I assumed the patient's first name is 'Veum' and last name is '823'.",5.035126447677612

[SQL]: SELECT sc.code FROM allergies a JOIN snomed_codes sc ON a.snomed_code_id = sc.id WHERE a.description = 'Allergy to substance (finding)';

This query joins the `allergies` table with the `snomed_codes` table on the `snomed_code_id` foreign key, and then filters the results to only include the row where the `description` column in the `allergies` table matches the specified string. The `SELECT` statement only retrieves the `code` column from the `snomed_codes` table, which is the desired output.",5.1432716846466064
Please provide me the amount transacted with the claim transaction ID 2f4595e0-ea2d-b0e8-d19f-362c3727638e.,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the given question.

[Q]: 'Please provide me the amount transacted with the claim transaction ID 2f4595e0-ea2d-b0e8-d19f-362c3727638e.'

[SQL]: SELECT ct.amount FROM claim_transactions ct WHERE ct.id='2f4595e0-ea2d-b0e8-d19f-362c3727638e';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the amount transacted, so we only need to select the `amount` column.
* The question provides a specific `claim transaction ID`, so we can filter the results using the `WHERE` clause.
* Since the question doesn't mention any other tables, we don't need to use a `JOIN` in this case.
* We assume that the `claim_transactions` table has an `id` column that matches the provided `claim transaction ID`.",6.3949480056762695
How many procedures are uncovered by the payer Dual Eligible?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[SQL]: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT p.id) 
FROM procedures p 
JOIN claims c ON p.claimid = c.id 
JOIN payers py ON c.payerid = py.id 
WHERE py.name = 'Dual Eligible' AND c.covered = FALSE;

Here's a brief explanation of the query:

* We're counting the distinct procedure IDs (`p.id`) that meet the conditions.
* We're joining the `procedures` table with the `claims` table on the `claimid` foreign key.
* We're joining the `claims` table with the `payers` table on the `payerid` foreign key.
* We're filtering the results to only include claims where the payer is 'Dual Eligible' and the claim is not covered (`c.covered = FALSE`).

Note that I'm assuming the existence of the following tables and columns:

* `procedures` table with an `id` column and a `claimid` foreign key.
* `claims` table with an `id` column, a `payerid` foreign key, and a `covered` column.
* `payers` table with an `id` column and a `name` column.

If these assumptions are incorrect, please provide more information about the database schema, and I'll be happy to adjust the query accordingly.",5.30718469619751
What is the description of the medication with code 860975?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[SQL]: SELECT m.description FROM medications m WHERE m.code = '860975';

Here's a brief explanation of the query:

* We only need to query the `medications` table since the question is about a specific medication code.
* We use the `WHERE` clause to filter the results to only include the medication with the code `860975`.
* We select only the `description` column, which is the relevant information requested in the question.",5.826353073120117
Could you provide information about the gender of the patient named Liana375 Abshire638?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'Could you provide information about the gender of the patient named Liana375 Abshire638?'

To answer this question, we need to query the `patients` table, which likely has columns for `first`, `last`, and `gender`. We can use the `WHERE` clause to filter the results based on the patient's name.

[SQL]: SELECT gender FROM patients WHERE first='Liana375' AND last='Abshire638';",3.778970241546631
Please provide me the SOP description of the imaging study with the ID 5ad9a317-b195-585e-c638-29e057061c9e.,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the given question.

[Q]: 'Please provide me the SOP description of the imaging study with the ID 5ad9a317-b195-585e-c638-29e057061c9e.'

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT isop.sop_description 
FROM imaging_studies isop 
WHERE isop.id='5ad9a317-b195-585e-c638-29e057061c9e';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the SOP description of a specific imaging study with a given ID.
* Since the question only mentions the imaging study ID, we can directly query the `imaging_studies` table.
* We use the `SELECT DISTINCT` statement to retrieve the unique SOP description.
* We filter the results using the `WHERE` clause with the given ID.

Note: If the `imaging_studies` table has a foreign key referencing another table, and the question required joining with that table, I would use a `JOIN` statement accordingly. However, based on the provided information, a simple query on the `imaging_studies` table suffices.",5.169386863708496
Please provide me the encounters that are related to the imaging study with the ID e8a95552-1cdf-3efd-19b5-84c659f2d3a1.,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the given question.

[Q]: 'Please provide me the encounters that are related to the imaging study with the ID e8a95552-1cdf-3efd-19b5-84c659f2d3a1.'

To answer this question, I'll assume there are three tables: `encounters`, `imaging_studies`, and `imaging_study_encounters` (a junction table to establish the many-to-many relationship between `imaging_studies` and `encounters`).

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: 
SELECT DISTINCT e.id, e.date, e.description 
FROM imaging_studies is 
JOIN imaging_study_encounters ise ON is.id = ise.imaging_study_id 
JOIN encounters e ON ise.encounter_id = e.id 
WHERE is.id = 'e8a95552-1cdf-3efd-19b5-84c659f2d3a1';

This query joins the `imaging_studies` table with the `imaging_study_encounters` table on the `imaging_study_id` foreign key, and then joins the result with the `encounters` table on the `encounter_id` foreign key. The `WHERE` clause filters the results to only include encounters related to the imaging study with the specified ID. The `SELECT` statement retrieves the relevant columns from the `encounters` table.",6.425464153289795

[Q]: 'Please provide me the number of encounters uncovered by the payer with the ID d18ef2e6-ef40-324c-be54-34a5ee865625.'

To answer this question, I'll assume there are three tables: `payers`, `claims`, and `encounters`. The `payers` table has a column `id` with the payer's ID, the `claims` table has a column `payerid` that references the `id` column in the `payers` table, and the `encounters` table has a column `claimid` that references the `id` column in the `claims` table.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT e.id) 
FROM payers p 
JOIN claims cl ON p.id = cl.payerid 
JOIN encounters e ON cl.id = e.claimid 
WHERE p.id = 'd18ef2e6-ef40-324c-be54-34a5ee865625';

This query joins the `payers`, `claims`, and `encounters` tables using their respective foreign keys, filters the results to only include the payer with the specified ID, and then counts the distinct number of encounters uncovered by that payer.",6.362823247909546
How many immunizations are covered by the payer NO_INSURANCE?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'How many immunizations are covered by the payer NO_INSURANCE?'

To answer this question, I'll assume there are two tables: `payers` and `immunizations`. The `payers` table has a column `name` with the payer name, and the `immunizations` table has a column `payer_id` that references the `id` column in the `payers` table.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT i.id) 
FROM immunizations i 
JOIN payers p ON i.payer_id = p.id 
WHERE p.name = 'NO_INSURANCE';

This query joins the `immunizations` table with the `payers` table on the `payer_id` column, filters the results to only include immunizations covered by the payer 'NO_INSURANCE', and then counts the distinct immunization IDs.",6.109872341156006
Please provide me the encounters that are related to the immunization with code 208.,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the given question.

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT e.* 
FROM encounters e 
JOIN immunizations i ON e.id = i.encounterid 
WHERE i.code = 208;

Here's a brief explanation of the query:

* We're selecting all columns (`*`) from the `encounters` table (`e`), as the question asks for the encounters related to the immunization with code 208.
* We're joining the `encounters` table with the `immunizations` table on the `encounterid` foreign key, as the immunization is related to an encounter.
* We're filtering the results to only include immunizations with code 208 using the `WHERE` clause.

Note: Assuming the table and column names are correct, and the foreign key relationship between `encounters` and `immunizations` is established through the `encounterid` column.",6.047890901565552
Please provide me the patients receiving aid under the care plan with code 385691007.,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'Please provide me the patients receiving aid under the care plan with code 385691007.'

To answer this question, we need to join the `patients`, `care_plans`, and `care_plan_codes` tables. We'll use the foreign keys to join these tables.

[SQL]: 
```
SELECT DISTINCT p.first, p.last 
FROM patients p 
LEFT JOIN care_plans cp ON p.id = cp.patientid 
LEFT JOIN care_plan_codes cpc ON cp.id = cpc.careplanid 
WHERE cpc.code = '385691007';
```

This query joins the `patients` table with the `care_plans` table on the `patientid` column, and then joins the result with the `care_plan_codes` table on the `careplanid` column. The `WHERE` clause filters the results to only include care plans with the code '385691007'. The `SELECT DISTINCT` statement ensures that we get unique patient names.",5.093350172042847

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT is.sop_code FROM imaging_studies is WHERE is.id='44f00920-e16d-916b-d956-8b0b2fe17e83';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the SOP code of the imaging study with a specific ID.
* Since the question mentions a specific ID, we can directly query the `imaging_studies` table.
* We use the `SELECT DISTINCT` statement to retrieve the unique SOP code.
* We filter the results using the `WHERE` clause with the provided ID.

Note: Assuming the `imaging_studies` table has columns `id` and `sop_code`, and the ID is a unique identifier for each imaging study.",5.156079053878784

How long does amLODIPine 2.5 MG Oral Tablet effect last?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

Since the question asks about the effect duration of a specific medication (amLODIPine 2.5 MG Oral Tablet), I'll assume there are tables for medications and their effects. Let's assume the table structures are as follows:

* `medications` table: `id`, `name`, `dosage`
* `medication_effects` table: `id`, `medication_id` (foreign key referencing `medications.id`), `effect_duration`

Here's the SQL query to answer the question:

[SQL]: SELECT me.effect_duration FROM medications m JOIN medication_effects me ON m.id = me.medication_id WHERE m.name = 'amLODIPine 2.5 MG Oral Tablet';

This query joins the `medications` table with the `medication_effects` table on the `medication_id` foreign key, and then filters the results to only include the row where the medication name matches the specified value. The `SELECT` statement only retrieves the `effect_duration` column, which is the relevant information to answer the question.",4.2884814739227295
What are the potential side effects and drug interactions associated with the medication Alendronic acid 10 MG Oral Tablet?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

SELECT DISTINCT se.side_effects, di.drug_interactions 
FROM medications m 
LEFT JOIN side_effects se ON m.id = se.medication_id 
LEFT JOIN drug_interactions di ON m.id = di.medication_id 
WHERE m.name = 'Alendronic acid 10 MG Oral Tablet';

Explanation:

* We need to query three tables: medications, side_effects, and drug_interactions.
* We use LEFT JOIN to ensure we get all results from the medications table, even if there are no matching side effects or drug interactions.
* We join the side_effects and drug_interactions tables with the medications table using the medication_id foreign key.
* We filter the results to only include the medication 'Alendronic acid 10 MG Oral Tablet' using the WHERE clause.
* We use DISTINCT to remove duplicate side effects and drug interactions.
* We only select the relevant columns: side_effects and drug_interactions.",6.096644163131714
Please provide me the name of the payer associated with the encounter f089788c-9ab8-830b-bee8-272f85e519e3.,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'Please provide me the name of the payer associated with the encounter f089788c-9ab8-830b-bee8-272f85e519e3.'

To answer this question, I'll assume there are three tables: `encounters`, `claims`, and `payers`. The `encounters` table has a foreign key `claimid` referencing the `id` column in the `claims` table. The `claims` table has a foreign key `payerid` referencing the `id` column in the `payers` table.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT p.name FROM encounters e 
        LEFT JOIN claims cl ON e.id = cl.encounterid 
        LEFT JOIN payers p ON cl.payerid = p.id 
        WHERE e.id = 'f089788c-9ab8-830b-bee8-272f85e519e3';

This query joins the `encounters` table with the `claims` table on the `encounterid` column, and then joins the resulting table with the `payers` table on the `payerid` column. The `WHERE` clause filters the results to only include the encounter with the specified ID. Finally, the query selects the `name` column from the `payers` table, which corresponds to the name of the payer associated with the encounter.",5.405512094497681

[Q]: 'Please provide me a list of patients associated with the payer with the ID d31fccc3-1767-390d-966a-22a5156f4219.'

To answer this question, we need to join the `patients` table with the `claims` table, and then join the `claims` table with the `payers` table, as the payer ID is associated with the claims, and the claims are associated with the patients.

[SQL]: 
```
SELECT DISTINCT p.first, p.last 
FROM patients p 
LEFT JOIN claims cl ON p.id = cl.patientid 
LEFT JOIN payers py ON cl.payerid = py.id 
WHERE py.id = 'd31fccc3-1767-390d-966a-22a5156f4219';

This query will provide a list of patients associated with the payer with the specified ID.",7.424753427505493
What is the encounter associated with the immunization with code 140?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'What is the encounter associated with the immunization with code 140?'

To answer this question, we need to join the `immunizations` table with the `encounters` table. Assuming there is a foreign key `encounterid` in the `immunizations` table that references the `id` column in the `encounters` table, we can write the following query:

[SQL]: SELECT e.id, e.date FROM immunizations i INNER JOIN encounters e ON i.encounterid = e.id WHERE i.code = 140;

This query will return the `id` and `date` of the encounter associated with the immunization with code 140.",5.245587110519409

What is the most promising procedure for a patient with Animal dander (substance)?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

Here's the query:

```
SELECT DISTINCT p.procedure 
FROM procedures p 
JOIN substances s ON p.substanceid = s.id 
WHERE s.name = 'Animal dander' 
ORDER BY p.efficacy DESC 
LIMIT 1;
```

Explanation:

* We need to find the most promising procedure for a patient with Animal dander (substance).
* We have two tables: `procedures` and `substances`.
* We join these tables on the `substanceid` foreign key.
* We filter the results to only include procedures related to Animal dander by specifying `s.name = 'Animal dander'`.
* We use the `ORDER BY` clause to sort the results by the `efficacy` column in descending order (highest efficacy first).
* Finally, we use the `LIMIT 1` clause to retrieve only the top-most promising procedure.

Note: This query assumes that the `procedures` table has an `efficacy` column that represents the effectiveness of each procedure, and that the `substances` table has a `name` column that contains the substance names. If these assumptions are incorrect, the query may need to be modified accordingly.",5.221253156661987
When was the care plan Diabetes self management plan used?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'When was the care plan Diabetes self management plan used?'

To answer this question, I'll assume there are two tables: `care_plans` and `care_plan_usages`. The `care_plans` table has columns `id`, `name`, and the `care_plan_usages` table has columns `id`, `care_plan_id`, and `used_at`.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT cpu.used_at FROM care_plans cp INNER JOIN care_plan_usages cpu ON cp.id = cpu.care_plan_id WHERE cp.name = 'Diabetes self management plan';

This query joins the `care_plans` table with the `care_plan_usages` table on the `care_plan_id` foreign key. It then selects the `used_at` column from the `care_plan_usages` table where the `name` column in the `care_plans` table is 'Diabetes self management plan'. The `DISTINCT` keyword is used to remove duplicate `used_at` values.",6.139081239700317

[Q]: 'What is the type of allergy has the description Latex (substance)?'

To answer this question, I'll assume there are two tables: `allergies` and `allergy_types`. The `allergies` table has columns `id`, `description`, and `allergytypeid`, and the `allergy_types` table has columns `id` and `type`.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT at.type FROM allergies a JOIN allergy_types at ON a.allergytypeid = at.id WHERE a.description = 'Latex (substance)';

This query joins the `allergies` table with the `allergy_types` table on the `allergytypeid` foreign key, and then selects the `type` column from the `allergy_types` table where the `description` column in the `allergies` table matches 'Latex (substance)'.",5.098211765289307
Please provide me the number of unique customers of the payer UnitedHealthcare.,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

Assuming there are two tables: `payers` and `customers`, where `payers` has columns `id` and `name`, and `customers` has columns `id`, `payer_id` (foreign key referencing `payers.id`), and other columns.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT c.id) FROM customers c INNER JOIN payers p ON c.payer_id = p.id WHERE p.name='UnitedHealthcare';

This query:

1. Joins the `customers` table with the `payers` table on the `payer_id` foreign key.
2. Filters the results to only include customers associated with the payer 'UnitedHealthcare'.
3. Uses the `COUNT(DISTINCT c.id)` aggregation function to count the number of unique customers.
4. Returns a single value, which is the count of unique customers.

Note: If the table structure or column names are different, the query may need to be adjusted accordingly.",6.109504461288452

[Q]: 'Please provide me the body site code of the imaging study with the ID 5ad9a317-b195-585e-c638-29e057061c9e.'

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT is.body_site_code FROM imaging_studies is WHERE is.id='5ad9a317-b195-585e-c638-29e057061c9e';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the body site code of the imaging study with a specific ID.
* Since the question only mentions the imaging study, we only need to query the `imaging_studies` table.
* We use the `SELECT DISTINCT` statement to retrieve the unique body site code.
* We filter the results using the `WHERE` clause to only include the imaging study with the specified ID.

Note: If the `body_site_code` column is not present in the `imaging_studies` table, we might need to join with another table that contains this information. However, based on the provided input, this query should work.",6.318449974060059

FROM encounters e 
WHERE e.id='a34a8d6e-fa04-0e16-2d61-fab2008713f9';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the reason code and description for a specific encounter ID.
* We can directly query the `encounters` table since the question only involves one table.
* We use the `WHERE` clause to filter the results for the specific encounter ID `a34a8d6e-fa04-0e16-2d61-fab2008713f9`.
* We use `SELECT DISTINCT` to ensure we get unique results, although in this case, it's unlikely to have duplicate reason codes and descriptions for the same encounter ID.",3.9979357719421387
What is the amount of the claims transferred with the claim transaction ID 1ef6fdcb-5c71-61fd-3481-b8d5616d4b30?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'What is the amount of the claims transferred with the claim transaction ID 1ef6fdcb-5c71-61fd-3481-b8d5616d4b30?'

[SQL]: SELECT ct.amount FROM claim_transactions ct WHERE ct.id='1ef6fdcb-5c71-61fd-3481-b8d5616d4b30';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the amount of the claims transferred with a specific claim transaction ID.
* Since we're looking for the amount, we only need to query the `amount` column.
* The claim transaction ID is used to filter the results, so we use it in the `WHERE` clause.
* We don't need to join any tables because the claim transaction ID is sufficient to identify the claim.

Note that if the `amount` column is not present in the `claim_transactions` table, the query would need to be modified accordingly.",6.225930452346802
What is the udi code for the device with code 706180003?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'What is the udi code for the device with code 706180003?'

To answer this question, I'll assume there are two tables: `devices` and `udi_codes`. The `devices` table has a column `code` with the value `706180003`, and the `udi_codes` table has a column `udi_code` that we want to retrieve. The two tables are connected through a foreign key `device_id` in the `udi_codes` table.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT uc.udi_code FROM devices d LEFT JOIN udi_codes uc ON d.id = uc.device_id WHERE d.code = '706180003';

This query joins the `devices` table with the `udi_codes` table on the `device_id` foreign key, filters the results to only include the device with code `706180003`, and selects the distinct `udi_code` values from the `udi_codes` table.",5.475371360778809

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT is.sop_code FROM imaging_studies is WHERE is.id='83028cf1-659e-8f10-d801-153a5fdd11f3';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the SOP code of the imaging study with a specific ID.
* Since the question only mentions the imaging study, we only need to query the `imaging_studies` table.
* We use the `DISTINCT` keyword to ensure we get a unique SOP code (in case there are duplicates, which is unlikely in this case).
* We filter the results using the `WHERE` clause with the specific ID provided in the question.

Note: If the `imaging_studies` table has a foreign key referencing another table, and the question required joining with that table, we would use a `JOIN` clause accordingly. However, in this case, the question only requires information from the `imaging_studies` table.",4.1650707721710205

To answer this question, I'll assume there are two tables: `immunizations` and `costs`. The `immunizations` table has columns `id`, `name`, and `cost_id`, and the `costs` table has columns `id` and `cost`.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT c.cost FROM immunizations i INNER JOIN costs c ON i.cost_id = c.id WHERE i.name = 'varicella';

This query joins the `immunizations` table with the `costs` table on the `cost_id` foreign key, and then selects the `cost` column from the `costs` table where the `name` column in the `immunizations` table is 'varicella'.",5.1310036182403564
What is the start date of medication with the code 197604?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[SQL]: SELECT m.start_date FROM medications m WHERE m.code='197604';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the start date of medication with a specific code, so we only need to query the `medications` table.
* We use the `WHERE` clause to filter the results based on the medication code mentioned in the question.
* Since we only need the start date, we only select the `start_date` column.

Note: If the `medications` table has a foreign key referencing another table, and the question required joining with that table, I would use a `JOIN` clause accordingly. However, based on the provided information, it seems that the `medications` table has the required information to answer the question.",4.967190265655518

Here's a brief explanation of the query:

* We start by selecting the payer with the ID '734afbd6-4794-363b-9bc0-6a3981533ed5' from the `payers` table.
* We then join the `coverage` table on the `payerid` foreign key to get the coverage information for this payer.
* Next, we join the `medications` table on the `medicationid` foreign key to get the medications covered by this payer.
* Finally, we use the `COUNT(DISTINCT m.id)` aggregation function to count the number of unique medications covered by this payer.

Note that I've used `COUNT(DISTINCT m.id)` to ensure we're counting each medication only once, even if it's covered multiple times by the same payer.",5.421422719955444

Can you give me the SNOMED code for the allergy with the code 256355007?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the given question.

[Q]: 'Can you give me the SNOMED code for the allergy with the code 256355007?'

To answer this question, I'll assume there are two tables: `allergies` and `snomed_codes`. The `allergies` table has a foreign key `snomed_code_id` that references the `id` column in the `snomed_codes` table.

[SQL]: SELECT sc.code FROM allergies a JOIN snomed_codes sc ON a.snomed_code_id = sc.id WHERE a.code = 256355007;

This query joins the `allergies` table with the `snomed_codes` table on the `snomed_code_id` foreign key, and then filters the results to only include the row where the `code` column in the `allergies` table matches the given value (256355007). The `SELECT` statement only retrieves the `code` column from the `snomed_codes` table, which is the SNOMED code for the allergy with the given code.",6.1468894481658936

[SQL]: SELECT MAX(stop) FROM allergies a LEFT JOIN patients p ON a.patientid = p.id WHERE a.code = '84489001';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks when the allergy with the code 84489001 stopped, so we need to query the `allergies` table.
* We're interested in the `stop` column, which indicates when the allergy stopped.
* Since we need to find the latest stop date, we use the `MAX` aggregation function.
* We use a `LEFT JOIN` with the `patients` table, assuming there's a foreign key `patientid` in the `allergies` table that references the `id` column in the `patients` table. This join is not strictly necessary in this case, but it's included to demonstrate the use of joins.
* We filter the results using the `WHERE` clause to only consider allergies with the code '84489001'.

Note that if the `stop` column is not of a date/time type, the `MAX` function might not work as expected. In that case, the query would need to be adjusted accordingly.",5.522514343261719
Please provide me the encounters that are related to the care plan Musculoskeletal care.,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

Assuming there are three tables: `encounters`, `care_plans`, and `care_plan_encounters` (a junction table to establish many-to-many relationships between `encounters` and `care_plans`).

What is the quality of the supply named Isolation gown  single-use (physical object)?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[SQL]: SELECT s.quality FROM supplies s WHERE s.name='Isolation gown single-use (physical object)';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the quality of a specific supply, so we only need to query the `supplies` table.
* We use the `WHERE` clause to filter the results to the specific supply named 'Isolation gown single-use (physical object)'.
* We only select the `quality` column, as it's the only relevant information required to answer the question.

Note: If the `supplies` table has a composite primary key or other constraints, the query might need to be adjusted accordingly. However, based on the provided information, this query should be sufficient.",4.964848279953003
What is the description of the observation with the code 8480-6?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'What is the description of the observation with the code 8480-6?'

To answer this question, I'll assume there are two tables: `observations` and `codes`. The `observations` table has columns `id`, `code_id`, and `description`, and the `codes` table has columns `id` and `code`.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT o.description FROM observations o LEFT JOIN codes c ON o.code_id = c.id WHERE c.code = '8480-6';

This query joins the `observations` table with the `codes` table on the `code_id` column, and then filters the results to only include the observation with the code '8480-6'. The `SELECT` statement only retrieves the `description` column, which is the relevant information requested in the question.",5.022264719009399

JOIN medications m ON c.medicationid = m.id 
WHERE p.id='8fa6c185-e44e-3e34-8bd8-39be8694f4ce';

Here's a brief explanation of the query:

* We start by selecting the `id` column from the `medications` table, using `COUNT(DISTINCT ...)` to get the number of unique medications.
* We join the `payers` table with the `coverage` table on the `payerid` foreign key.
* We then join the `coverage` table with the `medications` table on the `medicationid` foreign key.
* Finally, we filter the results to only include the payer with the specified ID using the `WHERE` clause.

Note that I'm assuming the existence of the following tables and columns:

* `payers` table with an `id` column
* `coverage` table with `payerid` and `medicationid` columns
* `medications` table with an `id` column",5.677889585494995

WHERE d.code = '702172008';

Here's a brief explanation of the query:

* We start by selecting the `description` column from the `encounters` table, which is the relevant column based on the question.
* We join the `devices` table with the `device_encounters` table on the `id` column, using the foreign key `deviceid`.
* We then join the `device_encounters` table with the `encounters` table on the `encounterid` column, using the foreign key `encounterid`.
* Finally, we filter the results to only include the device with the code `702172008` using the `WHERE` clause.

What is the base cost of the immunization with code 140?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'What is the base cost of the immunization with code 140?'

To answer this question, I'll assume there are two tables: `immunizations` and `codes`. The `immunizations` table has columns `id`, `code_id`, and `base_cost`, and the `codes` table has columns `id` and `code`.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT i.base_cost FROM immunizations i JOIN codes c ON i.code_id = c.id WHERE c.code = 140;

This query joins the `immunizations` table with the `codes` table on the `code_id` foreign key, and then filters the results to only include the row where the `code` column in the `codes` table is equal to 140. The `SELECT` statement only retrieves the `base_cost` column, which is the relevant information requested in the question.",5.203580379486084
What are the survival chances of allgery Allergy to substance (finding)?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

Since the question asks about the survival chances of a specific allergy, I'll assume there are tables for `allergies`, `findings`, and possibly `patients` or `outcomes`. Let's create a query based on these assumptions.

**Assumptions:**

* `allergies` table has columns `id`, `name`, and `description`
* `findings` table has columns `id`, `allergy_id` (foreign key referencing `allergies.id`), and `description`
* `outcomes` table has columns `id`, `finding_id` (foreign key referencing `findings.id`), and `survival_chance`

**Query:**

```sql
SELECT f.description, AVG(o.survival_chance) AS avg_survival_chance
FROM findings f
JOIN allergies a ON f.allergy_id = a.id
JOIN outcomes o ON f.id = o.finding_id
WHERE a.name = 'Allergy to substance'
GROUP BY f.description;
```

This query:

1. Joins the `findings` table with the `allergies` table on the `allergy_id` foreign key.
2. Joins the resulting table with the `outcomes` table on the `finding_id` foreign key.
3. Filters the results to only include the specific allergy 'Allergy to substance' using the `WHERE` clause.
4. Groups the results by the `description` column of the `findings` table.
5. Calculates the average survival chance for each group using the `AVG` aggregation function.

Please note that this query assumes the existence of the mentioned tables and columns. If the actual database schema differs, the query may need to be adjusted accordingly.",6.5902674198150635
Who has been treated with the procedure of code 268556000?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'Who has been treated with the procedure of code 268556000?'

To answer this question, we need to join the `procedures` table with the `patients` table through the `claims` table, as a claim is associated with a patient and a procedure.

[SQL]: 
```
SELECT DISTINCT p.first, p.last 
FROM procedures pr 
JOIN claims cl ON pr.id = cl.procedureid 
JOIN patients p ON cl.patientid = p.id 
WHERE pr.code = '268556000';
```

This query joins the `procedures` table with the `claims` table on the `procedureid` foreign key, and then joins the `claims` table with the `patients` table on the `patientid` foreign key. It then filters the results to only include patients who have been treated with the procedure of code `268556000`. The `DISTINCT` keyword is used to remove duplicate patient names.",6.115585803985596
Please provide me the patients with the claim ID 650d627d-5a70-6c9c-35f9-3d7c306c1e54.,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I can create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the given question.

[Q]: 'Please provide me the patients with the claim ID 650d627d-5a70-6c9c-35f9-3d7c306c1e54.'

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT p.first, p.last FROM claims cl LEFT JOIN patients p ON cl.patientid= p.id WHERE cl.id='650d627d-5a70-6c9c-35f9-3d7c306c1e54';

This query joins the `claims` table with the `patients` table on the `patientid` foreign key, and then filters the results to only include patients with the specified claim ID. The `DISTINCT` keyword is used to ensure that each patient is only listed once, even if they have multiple claims with the same ID.",6.079242706298828
Please provide me the modality description of the imaging study with the ID 820778b8-5a19-9acf-9dbd-a3be1a1b4a47.,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'Please provide me the modality description of the imaging study with the ID 820778b8-5a19-9acf-9dbd-a3be1a1b4a47.'

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT i.modality_description FROM imaging_studies i WHERE i.id='820778b8-5a19-9acf-9dbd-a3be1a1b4a47';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the modality description of a specific imaging study with a given ID.
* Since the question only mentions the imaging study ID, we can directly query the `imaging_studies` table.
* We use the `SELECT DISTINCT` statement to retrieve the unique modality description for the specified imaging study ID.
* The `WHERE` clause filters the result to only include the imaging study with the ID `820778b8-5a19-9acf-9dbd-a3be1a1b4a47`.",5.117487668991089
What value does observation Tobacco smoking status have?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT o.value 
FROM observations o 
WHERE o.code = 'Tobacco smoking status';

Here's my reasoning:

* The question asks for the value of a specific observation, so I'm selecting only the ""value"" column from the ""observations"" table.
* The question specifies the observation code as ""Tobacco smoking status"", so I'm using a WHERE clause to filter the results to only include rows with this code.
* Since the question doesn't mention any other tables or relationships, I'm not using a JOIN in this query.
* I'm using the DISTINCT keyword to ensure that I only get unique values, in case there are multiple observations with the same code and value.",6.144503116607666
What encounter is associated with the supply named Blood lancet (physical object)?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

FROM supplies s 
JOIN encounters_supplies es ON s.id = es.supplyid 
JOIN encounters e ON es.encounterid = e.id 
WHERE s.name='Blood lancet (physical object)';

Here's the explanation:

* We need to find the encounter associated with the supply named 'Blood lancet (physical object)'.
* We start by selecting the `name` column from the `encounters` table, which is the relevant column for the answer.
* We join the `supplies` table with the `encounters_supplies` table on the `supplyid` foreign key, as it connects a supply to an encounter.
* We then join the `encounters_supplies` table with the `encounters` table on the `encounterid` foreign key, as it connects an encounter to a supply.
* Finally, we filter the results using the `WHERE` clause to only include the supply with the name 'Blood lancet (physical object)'.",5.540655136108398
On which date was the allergy with the code 111088007 recorded?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT a.recorded_date 
FROM allergies a 
JOIN patients p ON a.patient_id = p.id 
WHERE a.code = '111088007';

Here's a brief explanation of the query:

* We're selecting the `recorded_date` column from the `allergies` table, which is the relevant column based on the question.
* We're joining the `allergies` table with the `patients` table on the `patient_id` foreign key, as the question doesn't specify a particular patient, but we need to link the allergy to a patient.
* We're using the `WHERE` clause to filter the results to only include the allergy with the code `111088007`.
* We're using `DISTINCT` to remove any duplicate dates, in case the same allergy was recorded multiple times on the same date.

Note that if the `recorded_date` column is not present in the `allergies` table, or if the `code` column is not present in the `allergies` table, the query would need to be adjusted accordingly.",5.197779178619385
Can you provide the count of patients suffering from the allergy with the code 735029006?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'Can you provide the count of patients suffering from the allergy with the code 735029006?'

To answer this question, I'll assume there are three tables: `patients`, `allergies`, and `patient_allergies`. The `patient_allergies` table is a junction table that connects patients with their allergies.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT p.id) 
FROM patients p 
JOIN patient_allergies pa ON p.id = pa.patientid 
JOIN allergies a ON pa.allergyid = a.id 
WHERE a.code = '735029006';

This query joins the `patients` table with the `patient_allergies` table on the `patientid` column, and then joins the result with the `allergies` table on the `allergyid` column. The `WHERE` clause filters the results to only include patients with the allergy code '735029006'. Finally, the `COUNT(DISTINCT p.id)` function returns the count of unique patients suffering from this allergy.",5.143859624862671
What is the address of the provider named Ethyl508 Rau926?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[SQL]: SELECT p.address FROM providers p WHERE p.first='Ethyl508' AND p.last='Rau926';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the address of a specific provider, so we only need to query the `providers` table.
* We use the `WHERE` clause to filter the results based on the provider's first and last names, which are 'Ethyl508' and 'Rau926', respectively.
* Since we only need the address, we select only the `address` column from the `providers` table.

Note: If the provider's name is not unique, we might need to use additional columns to identify the correct provider. However, based on the given input, this query should provide the correct answer.",5.99149489402771

WHERE i.code = 114;

Here's a brief explanation of the query:

* We're selecting all columns (`*`) from the `encounters` table (`e`), as the question asks for the encounters related to the immunization with code 114.
* We're joining the `encounters` table with the `immunizations` table (`i`) on the `encounterid` foreign key, which links an immunization to its corresponding encounter.
* We're filtering the results to only include immunizations with the code 114 using the `WHERE` clause.

Note that I'm assuming the existence of the `encounterid` foreign key in the `immunizations` table, which links an immunization to its corresponding encounter. If this assumption is incorrect, please provide more information about the table schema.",5.078052043914795

FROM patients p 
LEFT JOIN healthcare_coverage hc ON p.id = hc.patientid 
WHERE p.first='Hong136' AND p.last='Boehm581';

Here's a brief explanation of the query:

* We need to find the healthcare coverage status of a specific patient, so we start by selecting the relevant columns: `p.first`, `p.last`, and `hc.status`.
* We join the `patients` table with the `healthcare_coverage` table using the `patientid` foreign key.
* We filter the results to only include the patient with the name 'Hong136 Boehm581' using the `WHERE` clause.

Note that I assume the existence of a `healthcare_coverage` table with a `patientid` foreign key referencing the `id` column in the `patients` table, and a `status` column containing the healthcare coverage status. If this is not the case, please provide more information about the database schema.",4.636245965957642

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT cp.startdate FROM care_plans cp LEFT JOIN care_plan_codes cpc ON cp.id = cpc.careplanid WHERE cpc.code = '53950000';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks when the care plan with the code 53950000 was used, so we need to query the `care_plans` table for the `startdate` column.
* Since the care plan code is mentioned, we need to join the `care_plans` table with the `care_plan_codes` table using the foreign key `careplanid`.
* We use the `WHERE` clause to filter the results to only include the care plan with the code '53950000'.
* We use `DISTINCT` to remove any duplicate start dates, in case the same care plan was used multiple times.

Note: Assuming the table and column names are correct, if the schema is different, the query might need to be adjusted accordingly.",5.089276075363159

[SQL]: SELECT a.description FROM allergies a LEFT JOIN codes c ON a.code_id = c.id WHERE c.code = '256277009';

This query joins the `allergies` table with the `codes` table on the `code_id` foreign key, and then filters the results to only include the row where the `code` column in the `codes` table matches the given code '256277009'. The `SELECT` statement only retrieves the `description` column from the `allergies` table.",5.501225471496582
Please provide me the patients with the allergy with the code 735971005.,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'Please provide me the patients with the allergy with the code 735971005.'

To answer this question, we need to join the `patients` table with the `allergies` table, and then filter the results to only include patients with the specific allergy code.

[SQL]: 
```
SELECT DISTINCT p.first, p.last 
FROM patients p 
LEFT JOIN allergies a ON p.id = a.patientid 
WHERE a.code = '735971005';
```

Here's a brief explanation of the query:

* We start by selecting the `first` and `last` columns from the `patients` table, using `DISTINCT` to remove duplicates.
* We join the `patients` table with the `allergies` table on the `patientid` foreign key.
* We filter the results using the `WHERE` clause to only include patients with the specific allergy code `735971005`.

Note that I'm assuming the `allergies` table has a `code` column that matches the allergy code mentioned in the question, and a `patientid` foreign key that references the `id` column in the `patients` table. If the table structure is different, the query may need to be adjusted accordingly.",5.246492147445679
Can you tell me when the observation Heart rate was recorded?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'Can you tell me when the observation Heart rate was recorded?'

To answer this question, I'll assume there are two tables: `observations` and `patients`. The `observations` table has columns `id`, `patientid`, `observation_type`, and `recorded_at`, and the `patients` table has columns `id`, `first`, and `last`. The foreign key is `patientid` in the `observations` table, which references the `id` column in the `patients` table.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT o.recorded_at FROM observations o WHERE o.observation_type='Heart rate';

This query selects the distinct `recorded_at` timestamps from the `observations` table where the `observation_type` is 'Heart rate'. Since the question doesn't ask for patient information, we don't need to join the `patients` table.",6.103098392486572
What is the birthplace of the patient named Brittanie254 Murphy561?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[SQL]: SELECT p.birthplace FROM patients p WHERE p.first='Brittanie254' AND p.last='Murphy561';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the birthplace of a specific patient, so we only need to query the `patients` table.
* We use the `WHERE` clause to filter the results based on the patient's first and last names, which are `Brittanie254` and `Murphy561`, respectively.
* We only select the `birthplace` column, as it's the only relevant information required to answer the question.",5.2992401123046875
What is the start date of the procedure with the code 76601001?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'What is the start date of the procedure with the code 76601001?'

To answer this question, I'll assume there are two tables: `procedures` and `procedure_codes`. The `procedures` table has columns `id`, `start_date`, and `procedure_code_id`, while the `procedure_codes` table has columns `id` and `code`.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT p.start_date FROM procedures p INNER JOIN procedure_codes pc ON p.procedure_code_id = pc.id WHERE pc.code = '76601001';

This query joins the `procedures` table with the `procedure_codes` table on the `procedure_code_id` foreign key, and then filters the results to only include the procedure with the code '76601001'. The `SELECT` statement only retrieves the `start_date` column, which is the relevant information requested in the question.",5.0565009117126465
What are the typical symptoms of the allergy described as House dust mite (organism)?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

Here's the query:

```
SELECT DISTINCT s.description 
FROM allergies a 
JOIN symptoms s ON a.id = s.allergyid 
WHERE a.description = 'House dust mite (organism)';
```

Explanation:

* The question asks for the typical symptoms of the allergy described as ""House dust mite (organism)"".
* We need to join the `allergies` table with the `symptoms` table using the foreign key `allergyid`.
* We filter the results to only include the allergy with the description ""House dust mite (organism)"".
* We select the distinct `description` column from the `symptoms` table, which represents the typical symptoms of the allergy.

Note: Assuming the table and column names are correct, if the schema is different, the query might need to be adjusted accordingly.",4.9998040199279785
Please provide me the address of the provider named Ramon749 Johnston597.,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[SQL]: SELECT p.address FROM providers p WHERE p.first='Ramon749' AND p.last='Johnston597';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the address of a specific provider, so we only need to query the `providers` table.
* We use the `WHERE` clause to filter the results based on the provider's first and last names, which are 'Ramon749' and 'Johnston597', respectively.
* Since we only need the address, we select only the `address` column from the `providers` table.

Note: Assuming the `providers` table has columns `first`, `last`, and `address`, and the provider's full name is stored in separate columns for first and last names. If the full name is stored in a single column, the query would need to be adjusted accordingly.",6.119781970977783
What is the stop date of the condition Medication review due (situation)?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

Since the question asks for the stop date of a specific condition, I'll assume there are tables for conditions and their corresponding stop dates. Let's assume the tables are named ""conditions"" and ""condition_instances"".

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT ci.stop_date FROM conditions c JOIN condition_instances ci ON c.id = ci.condition_id WHERE c.name = 'Medication review due (situation)';

This query joins the ""conditions"" table with the ""condition_instances"" table on the condition ID, and then filters the results to only include the condition with the name ""Medication review due (situation)"". The SELECT statement only retrieves the ""stop_date"" column, which is the relevant information requested in the question.",4.943790674209595
What is the gender of the patient named Paris331 Waters156?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[SQL]: SELECT p.gender FROM patients p WHERE p.first='Paris331' AND p.last='Waters156';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the gender of a specific patient, so we only need to query the `patients` table.
* We use the `WHERE` clause to filter the patient with the first name 'Paris331' and last name 'Waters156'.
* Since we only need the gender of the patient, we select only the `gender` column from the `patients` table.",4.889473915100098

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT c.county 
FROM patients p 
LEFT JOIN addresses a ON p.addressid = a.id 
WHERE p.id='0d8b0b0e-b545-4bd9-9aa1-871946323a82';

Here's the explanation:

* We need to find the county of residence of the patient with the ID 0d8b0b0e-b545-4bd9-9aa1-871946323a82.
* The patient's ID is used to join the `patients` table with the `addresses` table using the `addressid` foreign key.
* We only need the `county` column from the `addresses` table, so we select only that column.
* We use `DISTINCT` to ensure we get a single result, even if there are multiple addresses with the same county.
* The `WHERE` clause filters the result to the specific patient ID mentioned in the question.",5.245671510696411
When did the allergy described as Allergy to substance (finding) stop?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'When did the allergy described as Allergy to substance (finding) stop?'

To answer this question, I'll assume there are two tables: `allergies` and `findings`. The `allergies` table has columns `id`, `patientid`, `findingid`, and `stop_date`, and the `findings` table has columns `id` and `description`.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT a.stop_date FROM allergies a JOIN findings f ON a.findingid = f.id WHERE f.description = 'Allergy to substance';

This query joins the `allergies` table with the `findings` table on the `findingid` column, and then filters the results to only include the row where the `description` is 'Allergy to substance'. The `stop_date` column is selected, which answers the question of when the allergy stopped.",5.057742357254028
Please provide me the patients treated with the procedure Assessment of substance use (procedure).,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'Please provide me the patients treated with the procedure Assessment of substance use (procedure).'

To answer this question, I'll assume there are three tables: `patients`, `procedures`, and `treatments`. The `treatments` table has foreign keys to `patients` and `procedures`.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: 
SELECT DISTINCT p.first, p.last 
FROM treatments t 
JOIN patients p ON t.patientid = p.id 
JOIN procedures pr ON t.procedureid = pr.id 
WHERE pr.name = 'Assessment of substance use';

This query joins the `treatments` table with `patients` and `procedures` tables using their respective foreign keys. It then filters the results to only include patients who have undergone the 'Assessment of substance use' procedure. The `DISTINCT` keyword ensures that each patient is only listed once, even if they have undergone the procedure multiple times.",6.086233854293823

[SQL]: SELECT e.snomed_code FROM encounters e WHERE e.id='3990e6c1-8783-3bc8-5a31-0bc25202a71c';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the SNOMED code of a specific encounter, so we only need to query the `encounters` table.
* We use the `WHERE` clause to filter the results based on the provided encounter ID.
* Since we only need the SNOMED code, we only select that column in the `SELECT` statement.

Note: If the SNOMED code is stored in a separate table, we would need to use a `JOIN` to retrieve the code. However, based on the provided information, it seems that the SNOMED code is stored in the `encounters` table itself.",5.019536733627319
How many procedures are covered by the payer NO_INSURANCE?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

WHERE is.id='1253afc5-02e2-4d25-a878-6b1d7a8f2cc9';

Here's a brief explanation of the query:

* We're selecting the `body_site_description` column from the `imaging_study_descriptions` table, which is the relevant column based on the question.
* We're joining the `imaging_studies` table with the `imaging_study_descriptions` table on the `imaging_study_id` foreign key.
* We're filtering the results to only include the imaging study with the ID `1253afc5-02e2-4d25-a878-6b1d7a8f2cc9`.
* We're using `DISTINCT` to remove any duplicate results, although it's unlikely in this case since we're filtering by a unique ID.",5.14030385017395
What encounter is required during the use of the device with code 170615005?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the given question.

[Q]: 'What encounter is required during the use of the device with code 170615005?'

To answer this question, I'll assume there are three tables: devices, encounters, and device_encounters (which is a junction table to establish a many-to-many relationship between devices and encounters).

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: 
SELECT DISTINCT e.name 
FROM devices d 
JOIN device_encounters de ON d.id = de.deviceid 
JOIN encounters e ON de.encounterid = e.id 
WHERE d.code = '170615005';

This query joins the devices table with the device_encounters table on the deviceid foreign key, and then joins the resulting table with the encounters table on the encounterid foreign key. It filters the results to only include the device with code '170615005' and returns the distinct encounter names required during the use of this device.",7.270933151245117

[SQL]: SELECT o.name FROM encounters e LEFT JOIN organizations o ON e.organizationid = o.id WHERE e.id='e0a7a78f-97cc-8ce2-dc9d-f88a975e9ca4';

Here's the explanation:

* We need to find the organization associated with a specific encounter, so we'll query the `encounters` and `organizations` tables.
* We'll use the `LEFT JOIN` to combine the two tables based on the foreign key `organizationid` in the `encounters` table, which references the `id` column in the `organizations` table.
* We'll filter the results to only include the encounter with the specified ID using the `WHERE` clause.

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT p.name FROM payers p WHERE p.id='26aab0cd-6aba-3e1b-ac5b-05c8867e762c';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the name of the payer with a specific ID, so we only need to query the `payers` table.
* We use the `DISTINCT` keyword to ensure we get a unique result, even though it's unlikely to have duplicate names with the same ID.
* We filter the results using the `WHERE` clause with the provided ID.

Note that if the `id` column is the primary key in the `payers` table, the `DISTINCT` keyword might not be necessary, as the ID would already be unique. However, to be safe, I've included it to ensure a unique result.",5.491605520248413
What is the description of the device with code 170615005?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'What is the description of the device with code 170615005?'

To answer this question, I'll assume there are two tables: `devices` and `device_codes`. The `devices` table has columns `id`, `description`, and the `device_codes` table has columns `id`, `device_id` (foreign key referencing the `id` column in `devices`), and `code`.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT d.description FROM devices d LEFT JOIN device_codes dc ON d.id = dc.device_id WHERE dc.code = '170615005';

This query joins the `devices` table with the `device_codes` table on the `device_id` foreign key, and then filters the results to only include the device with the code '170615005'. The `SELECT` statement only retrieves the `description` column, which is the relevant information requested in the question.",5.062924146652222
How many new employees have been hired in the past month?,"To answer this question, I'll assume there are two tables: `employees` and `hiring_info`. The `employees` table has columns `id`, `first`, `last`, and the `hiring_info` table has columns `employee_id` (foreign key referencing `employees.id`), `hire_date`.

Here's the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT e.id) 
FROM employees e 
JOIN hiring_info hi ON e.id = hi.employee_id 
WHERE hi.hire_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '1 month';

This query joins the `employees` table with the `hiring_info` table on the `employee_id` foreign key. It then counts the distinct `id`s of employees who have a `hire_date` within the past month.",5.928705215454102
Who is the patient associated with the supply with the code 463659001?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'Who is the patient associated with the supply with the code 463659001?'

To answer this question, we need to join the `supplies` table with the `patients` table through the `claims` table, as the `claims` table has foreign keys to both `supplies` and `patients`.

[SQL]: 
```
SELECT DISTINCT p.first, p.last 
FROM supplies s 
JOIN claims cl ON s.id = cl.supplyid 
JOIN patients p ON cl.patientid = p.id 
WHERE s.code = '463659001';
```

This query joins the `supplies` table with the `claims` table on the `supplyid` column, and then joins the `claims` table with the `patients` table on the `patientid` column. It then filters the results to only include the patient associated with the supply having the code `463659001`. The `DISTINCT` keyword is used to ensure we get unique patient names.",5.096038341522217

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the procedure code, so we only need to select the `procedure_code` column from the `imaging_studies` table.
* The question mentions the series UID, which is likely a unique identifier for the series table. We need to join the `imaging_studies` table with the `series` table on the `imaging_study_id` foreign key.
* We use the `WHERE` clause to filter the results based on the provided series UID.
* Since we only need distinct procedure codes, we use the `DISTINCT` keyword to remove duplicates.

Note that the exact table and column names might vary depending on the actual database schema. This query assumes that the tables and columns are named as mentioned in the question.",5.137660503387451

[Q]: 'Please provide the names of the patients that are linked with the organization with the ID 8e3ca57f-6f74-3d61-9803-ab1424290216.'

To answer this question, I'll assume there are three tables: `patients`, `organizations`, and `patient_organizations` (a junction table to link patients with organizations).

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: 
SELECT DISTINCT p.first, p.last 
FROM patient_organizations po 
JOIN patients p ON po.patient_id = p.id 
JOIN organizations o ON po.organization_id = o.id 
WHERE o.id = '8e3ca57f-6f74-3d61-9803-ab1424290216';

This query joins the `patient_organizations` table with both `patients` and `organizations` tables using their respective foreign keys. It then filters the results to only include patients linked with the organization having the specified ID. The `DISTINCT` keyword ensures that duplicate patient names are not returned.",6.162149429321289
Please provide me the quantity of the supply named Nitrile examination/treatment glove  non-powdered  sterile (physical object).,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

Here's the answer:

[SQL]: SELECT SUM(s.quantity) FROM supplies s WHERE s.name='Nitrile examination/treatment glove non-powdered sterile';

Explanation:

* The question asks for the quantity of a specific supply, so we only need to query the `supplies` table.
* We use the `SUM` aggregation function to calculate the total quantity of the specified supply.
* We filter the results using the `WHERE` clause to only include the supply with the exact name mentioned in the question.
* Since we're only interested in the quantity, we only select the `quantity` column.

Note: If the `supplies` table has a foreign key referencing another table (e.g., `orders` or `inventory`), and the question required joining with that table, I would use a `JOIN` clause accordingly. However, based on the provided information, it seems that the `supplies` table has the necessary information to answer the question.",6.131150960922241

Can you tell me when the observation Systolic Blood Pressure was recorded?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

Since the question asks about the observation ""Systolic Blood Pressure"", I assume there is a table ""observations"" with a column ""name"" that contains the observation name, and a column ""recorded_at"" that contains the timestamp when the observation was recorded.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT o.recorded_at FROM observations o WHERE o.name='Systolic Blood Pressure';

This query selects the distinct ""recorded_at"" timestamps from the ""observations"" table where the ""name"" column matches ""Systolic Blood Pressure"".",4.83995509147644

What encounter is associated with the observation Tobacco smoking status?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'What encounter is associated with the observation Tobacco smoking status?'

To answer this question, I'll assume there are three tables: `observations`, `encounters`, and `observation_encounters` (a bridge table to establish the many-to-many relationship between `observations` and `encounters`).

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: 
SELECT DISTINCT e.id, e.name 
FROM observations o 
JOIN observation_encounters oe ON o.id = oe.observation_id 
JOIN encounters e ON oe.encounter_id = e.id 
WHERE o.name = 'Tobacco smoking status';

This query joins the `observations` table with the `observation_encounters` table on the `observation_id` foreign key, and then joins the result with the `encounters` table on the `encounter_id` foreign key. The `WHERE` clause filters the results to only include the observation with the name 'Tobacco smoking status'. The `SELECT` statement retrieves the distinct `id` and `name` columns from the `encounters` table.",5.35005259513855
Which encounter is related to the allergy Allergy to substance (finding)?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'Which encounter is related to the allergy Allergy to substance (finding)?'

To answer this question, I'll assume the following tables and columns:

* `allergies` table with columns `id`, `name`, and `finding`
* `encounters` table with columns `id`, `patientid`, and `description`
* `allergy_encounter` table with columns `allergyid` and `encounterid` (this table establishes the many-to-many relationship between allergies and encounters)

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: 
```
SELECT DISTINCT e.description 
FROM allergies a 
JOIN allergy_encounter ae ON a.id = ae.allergyid 
JOIN encounters e ON ae.encounterid = e.id 
WHERE a.finding = 'Allergy to substance';
```

This query joins the `allergies` table with the `allergy_encounter` table on the `allergyid` column, and then joins the result with the `encounters` table on the `encounterid` column. The `WHERE` clause filters the results to only include encounters related to the allergy with the finding 'Allergy to substance'. The `SELECT DISTINCT` statement ensures that only unique encounter descriptions are returned.",6.683519124984741

[Q]: 'Please provide me the procedure code of the claim transaction 12060378-1ce9-656d-109c-9d6b8236981a.'

To answer this question, I'll assume there are two tables: `claims` and `procedures`. The `claims` table has a column `id` which is the claim transaction ID, and the `procedures` table has a column `claim_id` which is a foreign key referencing the `id` column in the `claims` table. The `procedures` table also has a column `code` which stores the procedure code.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT p.code FROM claims cl LEFT JOIN procedures p ON cl.id = p.claim_id WHERE cl.id='12060378-1ce9-656d-109c-9d6b8236981a';

This query joins the `claims` table with the `procedures` table on the `claim_id` foreign key, and then filters the results to only include the row with the specified claim transaction ID. The `SELECT` statement only retrieves the `code` column from the `procedures` table, which is the procedure code of the claim transaction.",5.274505138397217

FROM immunizations i 
JOIN claims cl ON i.claimid = cl.id 
JOIN payers p ON cl.payerid = p.id 
WHERE p.name = 'Anthem';

Explanation:

* We need to count the number of immunizations uncovered by the payer Anthem, so we'll use the `COUNT(DISTINCT i.id)` aggregation function to get the unique count of immunizations.
* We'll join the `immunizations` table with the `claims` table on the `claimid` foreign key.
* We'll then join the `claims` table with the `payers` table on the `payerid` foreign key.
* Finally, we'll filter the results to only include rows where the payer name is 'Anthem'.

[Q]: 'How many patients have or had the allergy with the code 419199007?'

To answer this question, we need to join the `patients` table with the `allergies` table, as the allergy code is stored in the `allergies` table, and we want to count the number of patients who have or had this allergy.

[SQL]: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT p.id) FROM patients p LEFT JOIN allergies a ON p.id = a.patientid WHERE a.code = '419199007';

Here's a brief explanation of the query:

* We use a `LEFT JOIN` to ensure that we include all patients, even if they don't have an allergy with the specified code.
* We join the `patients` table with the `allergies` table on the `patientid` foreign key.
* We filter the results to only include rows where the `code` column in the `allergies` table matches the specified code '419199007'.
* We use `COUNT(DISTINCT p.id)` to count the number of unique patients who have or had this allergy.

Here's a brief explanation of the query:

* We only need to query the `immunizations` table since the question only asks for the description of the immunization with code 140.
* We use the `SELECT DISTINCT` statement to ensure we get a unique description (in case there are duplicates, which is unlikely in this case).
* We filter the results using the `WHERE` clause to only include the immunization with code 140.

Note that if the `code` column is not unique in the `immunizations` table, we might get multiple descriptions for the same code. If that's the case, we might need to modify the query to handle this scenario. However, based on the provided information, this query should provide the correct answer.",5.303096771240234
What is the start date of the care plan with code 384758001?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'What is the start date of the care plan with code 384758001?'

To answer this question, I'll assume there are two tables: `care_plans` and `care_plan_codes`. The `care_plans` table has columns `id`, `start_date`, and `id` as the primary key. The `care_plan_codes` table has columns `care_plan_id` (foreign key referencing `care_plans.id`), `code`, and `id` as the primary key.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT cp.start_date FROM care_plans cp INNER JOIN care_plan_codes cpc ON cp.id = cpc.care_plan_id WHERE cpc.code = '384758001';

This query joins the `care_plans` table with the `care_plan_codes` table on the `care_plan_id` foreign key, and then filters the results to only include the care plan with the code '384758001'. The `SELECT` statement only retrieves the `start_date` column, which is the relevant information requested in the question.",5.198787212371826

WHERE s.uid='1.2.840.99999999.1.57895833.1595237299924';

Here's a brief explanation of the query:

* We need to find the modality code for the imaging study with a specific series UID.
* The series UID is unique to the series table, so we start by filtering on that.
* The series table is related to the imaging_studies table through the imaging_study_id foreign key, so we join those two tables.
* The instances table contains the modality code and is related to the series table through the series_id foreign key, so we join that table as well.
* We use DISTINCT to ensure we only get one modality code, even if there are multiple instances with the same modality.
* We filter on the specific series UID in the WHERE clause.",6.133059501647949

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT p.first, p.last FROM providers p WHERE p.id='60929372-c8fb-3c63-b72b-53b9c374b62b';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the name of the provider with a specific ID, so we only need to query the `providers` table.
* We use the `SELECT DISTINCT` statement to retrieve the `first` and `last` columns, which represent the provider's name.
* We filter the results using the `WHERE` clause, specifying the exact `id` value mentioned in the question.

Note that if the `id` column is the primary key in the `providers` table, the `DISTINCT` keyword might not be necessary, as the `id` would uniquely identify each provider. However, I've included it to ensure that we only get one result, even if there are duplicate names.",5.3748204708099365

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: 
```
SELECT DISTINCT e.id, e.date, e.description 
FROM encounters e 
JOIN encounter_procedures ep ON e.id = ep.encounterid 
JOIN procedures p ON ep.procedureid = p.id 
WHERE p.name = 'Screening for domestic abuse';
```

This query joins the `encounters` table with the `encounter_procedures` junction table on the `encounterid` foreign key, and then joins the `procedures` table on the `procedureid` foreign key. The `WHERE` clause filters the results to only include encounters related to the specific procedure 'Screening for domestic abuse'. The `SELECT` statement retrieves the relevant columns from the `encounters` table.",6.404863595962524
What city is the organization PATHWAYS HEALTHCARE LLC located in?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT o.city FROM organizations o WHERE o.name='PATHWAYS HEALTHCARE LLC';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the city of the organization 'PATHWAYS HEALTHCARE LLC'.
* Since the question only mentions the organization name, we can directly query the 'organizations' table.
* We use the 'name' column to filter the organization with the exact name 'PATHWAYS HEALTHCARE LLC'.
* We use the 'city' column in the SELECT statement to retrieve the desired information.
* We use the DISTINCT keyword to ensure we get a unique result, even if there are multiple entries for the same organization (although unlikely in this case).

Note: Assuming the 'organizations' table has columns 'name' and 'city', and the 'name' column is used to identify the organization. If the table structure is different, the query might need to be adjusted accordingly.",6.505727052688599

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT is.sop_code FROM imaging_studies is WHERE is.id='28269d80-93a4-03cd-26eb-1abe5dac1c6c';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the SOP code of the imaging study with a specific ID.
* Since the question only mentions the imaging study, we only need to query the `imaging_studies` table.
* We use the `WHERE` clause to filter the results based on the provided ID.
* We use `SELECT DISTINCT` to ensure we get a unique SOP code, even if there are multiple entries with the same ID (although this is unlikely in this case).

Note: If the `imaging_studies` table has a foreign key referencing another table, and the question required joining that table, we would use a `JOIN` clause accordingly. However, in this case, the question only requires information from the `imaging_studies` table.",5.176835298538208
In which encounter was the medication 24 HR Metformin hydrochloride 500 MG Extended Release Oral Tablet administered?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

JOIN administrations a ON m.id = a.medicationid 
JOIN encounters e ON a.encounterid = e.id 
WHERE m.name='24 HR Metformin hydrochloride 500 MG Extended Release Oral Tablet';

Here's the explanation:

* We need to find the encounter where the specific medication was administered, so we start with the medications table.
* We join the administrations table on the medicationid foreign key to link the medication to its administration.
* We then join the encounters table on the encounterid foreign key to link the administration to the encounter.
* Finally, we filter the results to only include the specific medication mentioned in the question.

[Q]: 'What is the category of the allergy with the code 264287008?'

To answer this question, I'll assume there are two tables: `allergies` and `categories`. The `allergies` table has columns `id`, `code`, and `category_id`, and the `categories` table has columns `id` and `name`.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT c.name FROM allergies a JOIN categories c ON a.category_id = c.id WHERE a.code = 264287008;

This query joins the `allergies` table with the `categories` table on the `category_id` foreign key, and then filters the results to only include the row with the specific `code` value. The `SELECT` statement only retrieves the `name` column from the `categories` table, which corresponds to the category of the allergy with the given code.",5.054944276809692

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT o.name FROM providers p LEFT JOIN organizations o ON p.organizationid = o.id WHERE p.id='7eeb1ff9-7fa1-316f-b23c-8c0ff3069296';

Here's the explanation:

* We need to find the organization affiliated with the provider with the given ID.
* We'll use the `providers` table to filter by the provider ID.
* We'll use the `organizations` table to get the affiliated organization.
* We'll use a LEFT JOIN to link the two tables using the `organizationid` foreign key in the `providers` table and the `id` column in the `organizations` table.
* We'll use the DISTINCT keyword to remove duplicates, if any.
* We'll select only the `name` column from the `organizations` table, as it's the relevant column for the question.",6.182908535003662
What is the classification of Allergy to substance (finding)?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

Since the question asks for the classification of ""Allergy to substance (finding)"", I assume there are tables for ""findings"" and ""classifications"" with a foreign key relationship between them.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT c.classification FROM findings f INNER JOIN classifications c ON f.classificationid = c.id WHERE f.name = 'Allergy to substance';

This query joins the ""findings"" table with the ""classifications"" table on the ""classificationid"" foreign key, and then selects the ""classification"" column where the ""name"" column in the ""findings"" table is 'Allergy to substance'.",4.902554273605347
Give me the base cost of the immunization SARS-COV-2 (COVID-19) vaccine  mRNA  spike protein  LNP  preservative free  100 mcg/0.5mL dose.,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the given question.

Assuming there are two tables: `vaccines` and `immunizations`. The `vaccines` table has columns `id`, `name`, and `base_cost`, and the `immunizations` table has columns `id`, `vaccine_id` (foreign key referencing `vaccines.id`), and `name`.

Here's the SQL query:

```
SELECT v.base_cost 
FROM vaccines v 
WHERE v.name = 'SARS-COV-2 (COVID-19) vaccine mRNA spike protein LNP preservative free 100 mcg/0.5mL dose';
```

This query directly queries the `vaccines` table, as the question only asks for the base cost of a specific vaccine. It uses the `WHERE` clause to filter the result to the specific vaccine mentioned in the question.",6.521945953369141
What value does observation Heart rate have?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

Since the question asks for the value of the observation ""Heart rate"", I'll assume there are two tables: ""observations"" and ""codes"" (or similar names). The ""observations"" table likely has a foreign key referencing the ""codes"" table, which contains the different observation codes (e.g., ""Heart rate"").

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT o.value FROM observations o JOIN codes c ON o.codeid = c.id WHERE c.name = 'Heart rate';

This query joins the ""observations"" table with the ""codes"" table on the ""codeid"" foreign key, and then filters the results to only include the observation with the code name ""Heart rate"". The ""value"" column from the ""observations"" table is selected, which should contain the desired value for the ""Heart rate"" observation.",4.050957202911377
What is the name of the payer with the ID 26aab0cd-6aba-3e1b-ac5b-05c8867e762c?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT p.name FROM payers p WHERE p.id='26aab0cd-6aba-3e1b-ac5b-05c8867e762c';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the name of the payer with a specific ID, so we only need to query the `payers` table.
* We use the `DISTINCT` keyword to ensure we get a unique result, even though it's unlikely to have duplicate names with the same ID.
* We filter the results using the `WHERE` clause with the provided ID.

Note that if the `id` column is the primary key in the `payers` table, the `DISTINCT` keyword might not be necessary, as the ID would already be unique. However, to be safe, I've included it to ensure a unique result.",6.044102430343628
How much revenue does the payer Anthem generate?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

Assuming there are two tables: `payers` and `claims`, where `payers` has columns `id` and `name`, and `claims` has columns `id`, `payerid`, and `amount`.

Here's the SQL query:

```
SELECT SUM(c.amount) AS revenue
FROM claims c
JOIN payers p ON c.payerid = p.id
WHERE p.name = 'Anthem';
```

This query joins the `claims` table with the `payers` table on the `payerid` foreign key, filters the results to only include claims from the payer 'Anthem', and then calculates the total revenue by summing up the `amount` column.",4.942826271057129

WHERE isu.id='54bd1183-378b-ae53-fe54-65c324c700d6';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the body site description of the imaging study with a specific ID.
* We need to join the `imaging_studies` table with the `imaging_study_descriptions` table using the foreign key `imaging_study_id`.
* We select only the `body_site_description` column from the `imaging_study_descriptions` table.
* We use the `WHERE` clause to filter the results for the specific imaging study ID.
* We use `DISTINCT` to remove any duplicate results, although it's unlikely in this case since we're filtering by a unique ID.",5.2950756549835205

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT o.type FROM observations o LEFT JOIN codes c ON o.codeid = c.id WHERE c.code = '56799-0';

Here's a brief explanation of the query:

* We're selecting the `type` column from the `observations` table, which is the relevant column based on the question.
* We're joining the `observations` table with the `codes` table using the `codeid` foreign key, which is assumed to be the link between the two tables.
* We're filtering the results to only include the observation with the code `56799-0` using the `WHERE` clause.

Who has been treated with the care plan with the code 736376001?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'Who has been treated with the care plan with the code 736376001?'

To answer this question, we need to join the `patients`, `encounters`, and `care_plans` tables. We'll assume the following table structure:

* `patients` table: `id`, `first`, `last`
* `encounters` table: `id`, `patientid` (foreign key referencing `patients.id`), `careplanid` (foreign key referencing `care_plans.id`)
* `care_plans` table: `id`, `code`

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: 
```
SELECT DISTINCT p.first, p.last 
FROM care_plans cp 
JOIN encounters e ON cp.id = e.careplanid 
JOIN patients p ON e.patientid = p.id 
WHERE cp.code = '736376001';
```

This query joins the `care_plans` table with the `encounters` table on the `careplanid` foreign key, and then joins the `encounters` table with the `patients` table on the `patientid` foreign key. The `WHERE` clause filters the results to only include care plans with the code `736376001`. The `SELECT DISTINCT` statement ensures we get unique patient names.",6.385807275772095

[SQL]: SELECT e.type FROM encounters e WHERE e.id='cb57f1aa-e89e-d66c-9c4e-4daeeb067a89';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks about the type of encounter, so we only need to query the `type` column.
* The encounter ID is provided, so we can use it in the `WHERE` clause to filter the results.
* Since the question only refers to the `encounters` table, we don't need to use a `JOIN`.
* We don't need to use `DISTINCT` or `DESC` in this case, as we're only retrieving a single value.
* We don't need to use `GROUP BY` either, as we're not aggregating any data.",4.4342803955078125

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the body site code of the imaging study with a specific ID.
* Since the question mentions a specific ID, we can directly query the `imaging_studies` table.
* We use the `SELECT DISTINCT` statement to retrieve the unique `body_site_code` column.
* We filter the results using the `WHERE` clause with the provided ID.

Note: Assuming the `imaging_studies` table has an `id` column and a `body_site_code` column. If the table structure is different, the query might need to be adjusted accordingly.",5.106454372406006
How long does lisinopril 10 MG Oral Tablet effect last?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

However, I must point out that the question ""How long does lisinopril 10 MG Oral Tablet effect last?"" cannot be directly answered with a SQL query because it requires a specific column or table that contains the duration of the effect. 

Assuming there is a table called ""medications"" with columns ""name"", ""dosage"", ""form"", and ""effect_duration"", and another table called ""medication_effects"" with columns ""medication_id"" and ""effect_duration"", we can create a query as follows:

[SQL]: SELECT me.effect_duration FROM medications m LEFT JOIN medication_effects me ON m.id = me.medication_id WHERE m.name='lisinopril' AND m.dosage='10 MG' AND m.form='Oral Tablet';

Please note that this query is based on the assumption of the table and column structure, which might not be the actual case. If the actual table structure is different, the query would need to be adjusted accordingly.",6.24817681312561

* Finally, we filter the results to only include encounters related to the device type 'Home continuous positive airway pressure unit' by specifying the `name` column in the `device_types` table.

Note that I assumed the existence of the `device_types` table and the `devicetypeid` foreign key in the `devices` table, as well as the `deviceid` foreign key in the `encounters` table. If the actual table structure is different, the query may need to be adjusted accordingly.",5.244558572769165
On which date was the allergy with the code 735029006 recorded?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT a.recorded_date 
FROM allergies a 
JOIN patients p ON a.patient_id = p.id 
WHERE a.code = '735029006';

Here's a brief explanation of the query:

* We're selecting the `recorded_date` column from the `allergies` table, which is the relevant column based on the question.
* We're joining the `allergies` table with the `patients` table on the `patient_id` foreign key, as the question doesn't specify a particular patient, but we need to link the allergy to a patient.
* We're using the `WHERE` clause to filter the results to only include the allergy with the code `735029006`.
* We're using `DISTINCT` to remove any duplicate dates, in case the same allergy code was recorded on the same date for multiple patients.

Note that if the `recorded_date` column is not present in the `allergies` table, or if the `code` column is not present in the `allergies` table, or if the foreign key relationship between `allergies` and `patients` is not established, the query would need to be adjusted accordingly.",6.245490074157715

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the code of the device with a specific UDI code.
* We need to join the `devices` table with the `udi_codes` table using the `deviceid` foreign key.
* We filter the results using the `WHERE` clause to match the specific UDI code provided in the question.
* We only select the `code` column from the `devices` table, as that's what the question asks for.

Note that I assumed the existence of the `devices` and `udi_codes` tables, as well as the `deviceid` foreign key in the `udi_codes` table. If the actual table and column names differ, the query would need to be adjusted accordingly.",6.117816686630249

What is the quality of the supply with the code 337388004?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[SQL]: SELECT s.quality FROM supplies s WHERE s.code='337388004';

Here's my reasoning:

* The question asks about the quality of a specific supply with a given code.
* Since the question only mentions the supply code, I assume there is a table called ""supplies"" with a column ""code"" that matches the given code.
* The question asks for the quality of the supply, so I select the ""quality"" column from the ""supplies"" table.
* I use a simple WHERE clause to filter the results to only include the supply with the code '337388004'.

Note: If the ""supplies"" table has a more complex structure or relationships with other tables, the query might need to be adjusted accordingly. However, based on the provided information, this query should provide the desired result.",4.998048305511475
What type of observation is Pain severity - 0-10 verbal numeric rating [Score] - Reported?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the given question.

Since the question asks about the type of observation, I'll assume there's a table called ""observations"" with a column ""type"" that stores the type of observation. Additionally, I'll assume there's a table called ""observation_values"" that stores the values of the observations, including the specific observation ""Pain severity - 0-10 verbal numeric rating [Score] - Reported"".

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT o.type FROM observations o LEFT JOIN observation_values ov ON o.id = ov.observation_id WHERE ov.value = 'Pain severity - 0-10 verbal numeric rating [Score] - Reported';

This query joins the ""observations"" table with the ""observation_values"" table on the ""id"" column, and then filters the results to only include the rows where the ""value"" column in the ""observation_values"" table matches the specified observation. The DISTINCT keyword is used to remove duplicates, and the SELECT statement only retrieves the ""type"" column from the ""observations"" table.",5.136478424072266
Please provide me the name of the patients related to the device Respiratory humidifier (physical object).,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'Please provide me the name of the patients related to the device Respiratory humidifier (physical object).'

To answer this question, I'll assume the following tables and columns:

* `devices` table with columns `id`, `name`

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT p.name FROM payers p WHERE p.id='0133f751-9229-3cfd-815f-b6d4979bdd6a';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the name of the payer with a specific ID, so we only need to query the `payers` table.
* We use the `WHERE` clause to filter the results based on the provided ID.
* Since we only need the name of the payer, we only select the `name` column.
* We use `DISTINCT` to ensure we get a unique result, even if there are multiple rows with the same name (although this is unlikely in this case).

[SQL]: SELECT e.ethnicity FROM patients p LEFT JOIN ethnicity e ON p.ethnicityid = e.id WHERE p.id='88c77778-4c35-0dbf-35cf-f58dbae35f0c';

Here's the explanation:

* We need to query the `patients` table to find the patient with the ID `88c77778-4c35-0dbf-35cf-f58dbae35f0c`.
* Since the question asks for the ethnicity, we need to join the `patients` table with the `ethnicity` table using the `ethnicityid` foreign key.
* We only need to select the `ethnicity` column from the `ethnicity` table.
* We use the `WHERE` clause to filter the patient with the specified ID.

What code does observation Body mass index (BMI) [Ratio] have?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'What code does observation Body mass index (BMI) [Ratio] have?'

To answer this question, I'll assume there are two tables: `observations` and `codes`. The `observations` table has columns `id`, `name`, and `code_id`, and the `codes` table has columns `id` and `code`.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT c.code FROM observations o INNER JOIN codes c ON o.code_id = c.id WHERE o.name = 'Body mass index (BMI) [Ratio]';

This query joins the `observations` table with the `codes` table on the `code_id` foreign key, and then selects the `code` column from the `codes` table where the `name` column in the `observations` table matches 'Body mass index (BMI) [Ratio]'.",6.081505537033081

[Q]: 'Please provide me the name of the provider associated with the encounter 1597c621-531d-e226-2c9b-911b6acea65f.'

To answer this question, I'll assume there are three tables: `encounters`, `providers`, and `encounter_providers` (a bridge table to establish the many-to-many relationship between encounters and providers).

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: 
SELECT DISTINCT pr.first, pr.last 
FROM encounters e 
JOIN encounter_providers ep ON e.id = ep.encounterid 
JOIN providers pr ON ep.providerid = pr.id 
WHERE e.id = '1597c621-531d-e226-2c9b-911b6acea65f';

This query joins the `encounters` table with the `encounter_providers` table on the `encounterid` foreign key, and then joins the result with the `providers` table on the `providerid` foreign key. The `WHERE` clause filters the result to only include the encounter with the specified ID. Finally, the `SELECT` statement retrieves the `first` and `last` names of the associated provider.",5.213371515274048

[Q]: 'What is the county of residence of the patient with the ID 4cabc73b-fcb4-871e-a9cc-bc0807a800c8?'

To answer this question, we need to join the `patients` table with the `addresses` table, as the county of residence is likely stored in the `addresses` table. Assuming there's a foreign key `patientid` in the `addresses` table that references the `id` column in the `patients` table.

[SQL]: SELECT a.county FROM patients p LEFT JOIN addresses a ON p.id = a.patientid WHERE p.id='4cabc73b-fcb4-871e-a9cc-bc0807a800c8';

This query joins the `patients` table with the `addresses` table on the `patientid` foreign key, and then filters the result to only include the patient with the specified ID. The `SELECT` statement only retrieves the `county` column, which is the desired information.",6.1503870487213135
When was the device Respiratory humidifier (physical object) implanted or initially used?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

Since the question asks about the device ""Respiratory humidifier"" and when it was implanted or initially used, I'll assume there are tables for devices, procedures, and possibly a join table for device-procedure relationships.

Here's the query:

```
SELECT DISTINCT p.procedure_date 
FROM devices d 
JOIN device_procedures dp ON d.id = dp.device_id 
JOIN procedures p ON dp.procedure_id = p.id 
WHERE d.name = 'Respiratory humidifier';
```

This query joins the `devices` table with the `device_procedures` table on the `device_id` foreign key, and then joins the result with the `procedures` table on the `procedure_id` foreign key. It then filters the results to only include the device ""Respiratory humidifier"" and selects the distinct `procedure_date` column.

Please note that this query assumes the existence of the mentioned tables and columns. If the actual table structure is different, the query may need to be adjusted accordingly.",5.166136741638184

FROM encounters e 
JOIN allergies a ON e.id = a.encounterid 
JOIN codes c ON a.codeid = c.id 
WHERE c.code = '288328004';

Explanation:

* We need to query the `encounters` table to get the required information.
* Since the question mentions ""allergy with the code 288328004"", we need to join the `allergies` table with the `encounters` table using the `encounterid` foreign key.
* Further, we need to join the `codes` table with the `allergies` table using the `codeid` foreign key to filter the specific code.
* We use the `WHERE` clause to filter the results based on the given code '288328004'.

Please provide me the patient with the supply with the code 972002.,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the given question.

[Q]: 'Please provide me the patient with the supply with the code 972002.'

To answer this question, we need to join the `patients`, `claims`, and `supplies` tables. Assuming the table structures are as follows:

- `patients` table: `id`, `first`, `last`
- `claims` table: `id`, `patientid` (foreign key referencing `patients.id`)
- `supplies` table: `id`, `claimid` (foreign key referencing `claims.id`), `code`

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: 
SELECT DISTINCT p.first, p.last 
FROM supplies s 
JOIN claims cl ON s.claimid = cl.id 
JOIN patients p ON cl.patientid = p.id 
WHERE s.code = '972002';

This query joins the `supplies` table with the `claims` table on the `claimid` foreign key, and then joins the `claims` table with the `patients` table on the `patientid` foreign key. It then filters the results to only include rows where the `code` column in the `supplies` table is '972002', and finally selects the distinct `first` and `last` columns from the `patients` table.",5.821094989776611

[SQL]: SELECT last FROM patients WHERE id='eef705a8-47f0-8615-da12-d6fe30a0262e';

This query directly queries the `patients` table, filtering by the provided `id` and selecting only the `last` column, which corresponds to the patient's last name.",7.039335250854492
When did the allergy with the code 419199007 stop?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'When did the allergy with the code 419199007 stop?'

To answer this question, I'll assume there are two tables: `allergies` and `allergy_history`. The `allergies` table has columns `id`, `code`, and `patientid`, and the `allergy_history` table has columns `id`, `allergyid`, `stop_date`, and `patientid`. The foreign key is `allergyid` in the `allergy_history` table, which references the `id` column in the `allergies` table.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT ah.stop_date FROM allergies a JOIN allergy_history ah ON a.id = ah.allergyid WHERE a.code = '419199007' ORDER BY ah.stop_date DESC LIMIT 1;

This query joins the `allergies` and `allergy_history` tables on the `allergyid` foreign key, filters the results to only include the allergy with code `419199007`, and then selects the most recent `stop_date` using the `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT 1` clauses.",3.2004780769348145

[Q]: 'Please provide me the name of the patients related to the device with code 170615005.'

To answer this question, we need to join the `patients` table with the `devices` table and the `device_patient` table (assuming this is the junction table for the many-to-many relationship between devices and patients).

[SQL]: 
```
SELECT DISTINCT p.first, p.last 
FROM devices d 
JOIN device_patient dp ON d.id = dp.deviceid 
JOIN patients p ON dp.patientid = p.id 
WHERE d.code = '170615005';
```

This query joins the `devices` table with the `device_patient` table on the `deviceid` column, and then joins the result with the `patients` table on the `patientid` column. The `WHERE` clause filters the results to only include devices with the code '170615005'. The `SELECT` statement retrieves the `first` and `last` names of the patients, and the `DISTINCT` keyword ensures that we don't get duplicate patient names in the result set.",6.244815111160278

Give me the base cost of the immunization IPV.,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[SQL]: SELECT base_cost FROM immunizations WHERE name='IPV';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the base cost of the immunization IPV, so we only need to query the `base_cost` column.
* Since the question mentions a specific immunization name (IPV), we can filter the results using the `WHERE` clause.
* We don't need to join any tables because the question only refers to a single entity (immunization).
* We don't need to use `DISTINCT` or `DESC` in this case, as we're only retrieving a single value.

Note: I assume that the `immunizations` table has a column named `name` that contains the immunization names, and a column named `base_cost` that contains the corresponding costs. If the column names are different, please let me know and I'll adjust the query accordingly.",5.0556862354278564

Here's the explanation:

* We need to find the type of allergy that has a description of ""Bee venom (substance)"".
* We have two tables: `allergies` and `allergy_descriptions`. The `allergy_descriptions` table likely has a foreign key `allergyid` that references the `id` column in the `allergies` table.
* We use a LEFT JOIN to combine the two tables on the `allergyid` and `id` columns.
* We filter the results to only include rows where the `description` column in the `allergy_descriptions` table matches ""Bee venom (substance)"".
* Finally, we select only the `type` column from the `allergies` table, which is the column that contains the answer to the question.",5.104803800582886

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT a.end FROM allergies a LEFT JOIN patients p ON a.patientid = p.id WHERE a.code = '84489001' AND a.end IS NOT NULL ORDER BY a.end DESC LIMIT 1;

Here's a brief explanation of the query:

* We're querying the `allergies` table, which is assumed to have columns `patientid`, `code`, and `end`.
* We're joining the `patients` table using the `patientid` foreign key to ensure we're getting the correct patient's allergy information.
* We're filtering the results to only include the allergy with the code `84489001`.
* We're using `AND a.end IS NOT NULL` to exclude any allergies without an end date.
* We're using `ORDER BY a.end DESC` to get the latest end date, and `LIMIT 1` to return only the most recent one.

Note that this query assumes the `allergies` table has an `end` column that represents the end date of the allergy, and that the `code` column matches the provided value. If the table structure is different, the query may need to be adjusted accordingly.",6.31251859664917

Please provide me the number of encounters uncovered by the payer NO_INSURANCE.,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'Please provide me the number of encounters uncovered by the payer NO_INSURANCE.'

To answer this question, I'll assume there are two tables: `encounters` and `claims`. The `claims` table has a column `payer` and the `encounters` table has a foreign key `claim_id` that references the `id` column in the `claims` table.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT e.id) 
FROM encounters e 
JOIN claims cl ON e.claim_id = cl.id

[Q]: 'Please provide me the patients with the condition with code 703151001.'

To answer this question, we need to join the `patients` table with the `conditions` table, as the condition code is stored in the `conditions` table. We'll use the `patientid` foreign key to join the two tables.

[SQL]: 
SELECT DISTINCT p.first, p.last 
FROM conditions c 
LEFT JOIN patients p ON c.patientid = p.id 
WHERE c.code = '703151001';",5.19284462928772
Please provide me the encounters that are related to the medication with the code 855332.,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the given question.

Here's the answer:

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT e.* FROM medications m 
JOIN medication_encounters me ON m.id = me.medicationid 
JOIN encounters e ON me.encounterid = e.id 
WHERE m.code = '855332';

Explanation:

* We start by selecting the columns from the `encounters` table (`e.*`) since the question asks for the encounters related to the medication with the code 855332.
* We join the `medications` table (`m`) with the `medication_encounters` table (`me`) on the `id` column, which is the foreign key.
* We then join the `medication_encounters` table (`me`) with the `encounters` table (`e`) on the `encounterid` column, which is the foreign key.
* Finally, we filter the results using the `WHERE` clause to only include the encounters related to the medication with the code 855332.

Note: I assume that the `medication_encounters` table is a bridge table that connects the `medications` and `encounters` tables, and that the `id` column in the `medications` table is the primary key, which is referenced by the `medicationid` column in the `medication_encounters` table, and similarly for the `encounters` table. If the schema is different, the query may need to be adjusted accordingly.",5.341634511947632
Please provide me the number of encounters uncovered by the payer with the ID e03e23c9-4df1-3eb6-a62d-f70f02301496.,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the given question.

[Q]: 'Please provide me the number of encounters uncovered by the payer with the ID e03e23c9-4df1-3eb6-a62d-f70f02301496.'

To answer this question, I'll assume there are three tables: `payers`, `claims`, and `encounters`. The `payers` table has a column `id`, the `claims` table has columns `id`, `payerid`, and `uncovered`, and the `encounters` table has columns `id` and `claimid`.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: 
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT e.id) 
FROM payers p 
JOIN claims cl ON p.id = cl.payerid 
JOIN encounters e ON cl.id = e.claimid 
WHERE p.id = 'e03e23c9-4df1-3eb6-a62d-f70f02301496' AND cl.uncovered = TRUE;

This query joins the `payers`, `claims`, and `encounters` tables using their respective foreign keys. It then filters the results to only include encounters that are uncovered (i.e., `cl.uncovered = TRUE`) and belong to the payer with the specified ID. Finally, it counts the distinct number of encounters that meet these conditions.",5.74868106842041
What is the encounter associated with the immunization with code 140?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'What is the encounter associated with the immunization with code 140?'

To answer this question, we need to join the `immunizations` table with the `encounters` table. Assuming there is a foreign key `encounterid` in the `immunizations` table that references the `id` column in the `encounters` table, we can write the following query:

[SQL]: SELECT e.id, e.date FROM immunizations i INNER JOIN encounters e ON i.encounterid = e.id WHERE i.code = 140;

This query will return the `id` and `date` of the encounter associated with the immunization with code 140.",6.987429141998291

```
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT p.id) 
FROM diagnoses d 
JOIN patients p ON d.patientid = p.id 
JOIN substances s ON d.substanceid = s.id 
WHERE s.name = 'Grass pollen';
```

Explanation:

* We need to count the number of patients diagnosed with Grass pollen, so we use `COUNT(DISTINCT p.id)` to get the unique patient count.
* We join the `diagnoses` table with the `patients` table on the `patientid` foreign key.
* We join the `diagnoses` table with the `substances` table on the `substanceid` foreign key.
* We filter the results to only include diagnoses with the substance name 'Grass pollen'.

Note: Assuming the table and column names are as follows:

* `diagnoses` table: `id`, `patientid`, `substanceid`
* `patients` table: `id`, `first`, `last`
* `substances` table: `id`, `name`",5.1363136768341064

[SQL]: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT p.id) 
FROM payers py 
JOIN procedures p ON py.id = p.payerid 
WHERE py.name='UnitedHealthcare';

Explanation:

* We need to count the number of procedures covered by the payer UnitedHealthcare, so we use the COUNT(DISTINCT p.id) function to get the unique procedure IDs.
* We join the payers table (py) with the procedures table (p) on the payerid foreign key.
* We filter the results to only include procedures covered by UnitedHealthcare by using the WHERE clause with py.name='UnitedHealthcare'.

Note: Assuming the tables and columns are named as follows:

* payers table: id (primary key), name
* procedures table: id (primary key), payerid (foreign key referencing payers.id)",6.0528013706207275
What is the code of the device with the udi code (01)80537193867928(11)710405(17)960419(10)66332062095421309(21)3215963876?,"Based on the provided question, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query. Here's the answer:

SELECT DISTINCT p.first, p.last 
FROM procedures pr 
JOIN encounters e ON pr.id = e.procedureid 
JOIN patients p ON e.patientid = p.id 
WHERE pr.name = 'Screening for drug abuse';
```

This query joins the `procedures` table with the `encounters` table on the `procedureid` foreign key, and then joins the `encounters` table with the `patients` table on the `patientid` foreign key. It then filters the results to only include patients who have had the 'Screening for drug abuse' procedure, and finally selects the distinct first and last names of these patients.",5.1438868045806885

* We need to join three tables: care_plans, patients, and care_plan_items.
* The care_plan_items table is joined with care_plans on the care_plan_id foreign key.
* The patients table is joined with care_plans on the patient_id foreign key.
* We filter the results to only include care plans with the name 'Respiratory therapy'.
* We select only the first and last names of the patients, as per the question.",6.049195289611816
What code does observation Body Height have?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'What code does observation Body Height have?'

To answer this question, I'll assume there are two tables: `observations` and `codes`. The `observations` table has columns `id`, `name`, and `code_id`, and the `codes` table has columns `id` and `code`.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT c.code FROM observations o INNER JOIN codes c ON o.code_id = c.id WHERE o.name = 'Body Height';

This query joins the `observations` table with the `codes` table on the `code_id` foreign key, and then selects the `code` column from the `codes` table where the `name` column in the `observations` table is 'Body Height'.",4.959076881408691
On which date did the illness associated to the claim ID 154e7c9a-d934-2fd5-55cf-129ba2536b59 occur?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'On which date did the illness associated to the claim ID 154e7c9a-d934-2fd5-55cf-129ba2536b59 occur?'

To answer this question, I'll assume there are three tables: `claims`, `illnesses`, and `diagnoses`. The `claims` table has a foreign key `id` that links to the `claim_id` in the `diagnoses` table, and the `diagnoses` table has a foreign key `illness_id` that links to the `id` in the `illnesses` table.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: 
SELECT i.occurrence_date 
FROM claims cl 
LEFT JOIN diagnoses d ON cl.id = d.claim_id 
LEFT JOIN illnesses i ON d.illness_id = i.id 
WHERE cl.id = '154e7c9a-d934-2fd5-55cf-129ba2536b59';

This query joins the `claims` table with the `diagnoses` table on the `claim_id` and then joins the `diagnoses` table with the `illnesses` table on the `illness_id`. It then selects the `occurrence_date` from the `illnesses` table where the `claim_id` matches the given ID.",5.784964084625244
Please provide me the encounters that are related to the observation with the code 9279-1.,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the given question.

Here's the answer:

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT e.* 
FROM observations o 
JOIN encounters e ON o.encounterid = e.id 
WHERE o.code = '9279-1';

Explanation:

* We need to query the `observations` table to find the observation with the code '9279-1'.
* Since we want to retrieve the related encounters, we need to join the `observations` table with the `encounters` table using the `encounterid` foreign key.
* We use `SELECT DISTINCT` to ensure we get unique encounter records.
* We use `e.*` to retrieve all columns from the `encounters` table, as the question doesn't specify which columns are required.
* The `WHERE` clause filters the results to only include observations with the code '9279-1'.",6.011656045913696

[Q]: 'What is the income status of the patient with the ID 3b7680fd-3c71-3998-aff8-b849f9253b37?'

To answer this question, I'll assume there are two tables: `patients` and `demographics`. The `patients` table has columns `id` and `demographics_id` (foreign key referencing the `id` column in the `demographics` table), and the `demographics` table has columns `id` and `income_status`.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT d.income_status FROM patients p LEFT JOIN demographics d ON p.demographics_id = d.id WHERE p.id='3b7680fd-3c71-3998-aff8-b849f9253b37';

This query joins the `patients` table with the `demographics` table on the `demographics_id` foreign key, and then filters the result to only include the patient with the specified ID. The `SELECT` statement only retrieves the `income_status` column, which is the relevant information requested in the question.",6.1912713050842285
Please provide me the name of the patients related to the device with code 706180003.,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'Please provide me the name of the patients related to the device with code 706180003.'

To answer this question, we need to join the `devices`, `patients`, and `device_patients` tables. Assuming the table structure is as follows:

- `devices` table: `id`, `code`
- `patients` table: `id`, `first`, `last`
- `device_patients` table: `device_id`, `patient_id` (foreign keys to `devices` and `patients` tables)

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: 
SELECT DISTINCT p.first, p.last

WHERE p.first = 'Claris36' AND p.last = 'Bogisich202';",5.732419013977051
Which illness is most common in warmer climates?,"To answer this question, we need to assume that there are tables for `patients`, `claims`, `illnesses`, and `locations`. We also need to assume that `locations` have a column for `climate` and `patients` have a column for `location_id` which is a foreign key referencing the `id` column in the `locations` table.

Here's a possible SQL query:

```
SELECT i.name, COUNT(DISTINCT p.id) as count
FROM patients p
JOIN locations l ON p.location_id = l.id
JOIN claims cl ON p.id = cl.patientid
JOIN illnesses i ON cl.illnessid = i.id
WHERE l.climate = 'warmer'
GROUP BY i.name
ORDER BY count DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

This query joins the `patients`, `locations`, `claims`, and `illnesses` tables to get the count of each illness in warmer climates. It then groups the results by illness name and orders them in descending order of count. Finally, it limits the result to the top 1, which is the most common illness in warmer climates.",4.245277166366577

[Q]: 'For which patient did the medication with the code 308136 is prescribed for?'

To answer this question, we need to join the `medications` table with the `prescriptions` table and then with the `patients` table. We'll use the foreign keys to establish the relationships between the tables.

[SQL]: 
```
SELECT DISTINCT p.first, p.last 
FROM medications m 
JOIN prescriptions pr ON m.id = pr.medicationid 
JOIN patients p ON pr.patientid = p.id

[Q]: 'What is the reason code and description of the encounter bae4790c-75ed-7f5e-1800-b0736da19320?'

[SQL]: SELECT e.reason_code, e.description FROM encounters e WHERE e.id='bae4790c-75ed-7f5e-1800-b0736da19320';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the reason code and description of a specific encounter with the ID 'bae4790c-75ed-7f5e-1800-b0736da19320'.
* Since the question only refers to the encounter, we only need to query the `encounters` table.
* We use the `WHERE` clause to filter the results to the specific encounter with the given ID.
* The `SELECT` statement only includes the `reason_code` and `description` columns, as they are the only relevant columns mentioned in the question.",5.624809265136719

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT is.studyuid FROM imagingstudies is WHERE is.id='3e8edf0b-1c48-156b-867a-e3fa42da1e91';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the series UID of the imaging study with a specific ID.
* We can find the series UID in the `imagingstudies` table, so we don't need to join any other tables.
* We use the `DISTINCT` keyword to ensure we get a unique result, even if there are multiple rows with the same ID (although this is unlikely in this case).
* We filter the results using the `WHERE` clause to only include the row with the specified ID.

Note that if the ID is not found in the `imagingstudies` table, this query will return an empty result set.",5.109556674957275
What is the most promising procedure for a patient with Mold (organism)?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

Assuming we have the following tables:

* `procedures`: with columns `id`, `name`, `promise_rating`
* `organisms`: with columns `id`, `name`
* `procedure_organisms`: a junction table with columns `procedure_id` (foreign key referencing `procedures.id`) and `organism_id` (foreign key referencing `organisms.id`)

Here's the SQL query to answer the question:

```
SELECT p.name
FROM procedures p
JOIN procedure_organisms po ON p.id = po.procedure_id
JOIN organisms o ON po.organism_id = o.id
WHERE o.name = 'Mold'
ORDER BY p.promise_rating DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

This query:

1. Joins the `procedures` table with the `procedure_organisms` junction table on the `procedure_id` foreign key.
2. Joins the resulting table with the `organisms` table on the `organism_id` foreign key.
3. Filters the results to only include rows where the `organism_name` is 'Mold'.
4. Orders the results by the `promise_rating` in descending order (highest rating first).
5. Limits the result to the top 1 row, which should be the most promising procedure for a patient with Mold (organism).

Note: If the `promise_rating` column is not present in the `procedures` table, or if there's no clear way to determine the most promising procedure, the query would need to be adjusted accordingly.",5.405992031097412
What is the base cost of the immunization with code 208?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'What is the base cost of the immunization with code 208?'

To answer this question, I'll assume there are two tables: `immunizations` and `codes`. The `immunizations` table has columns `id`, `code_id`, and `base_cost`, and the `codes` table has columns `id` and `code`.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT i.base_cost FROM immunizations i JOIN codes c ON i.code_id = c.id WHERE c.code = 208;

This query joins the `immunizations` table with the `codes` table on the `code_id` foreign key, and then filters the results to only include the row where the `code` column in the `codes` table is equal to 208. The `SELECT` statement only retrieves the `base_cost` column, which is the relevant information requested in the question.",6.194406747817993

[SQL]: SELECT o.address FROM organizations o WHERE o.id='fa09396a-2926-3b21-ad0c-9f6cabbce0eb';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the address of a specific organization with a given ID.
* Since the question only mentions the organization's ID, we can directly query the `organizations` table.
* We use the `WHERE` clause to filter the result based on the provided ID.
* The `SELECT` statement only includes the `address` column, as it's the only relevant information requested in the question.",6.09872579574585

JOIN payers p ON c.payerid = p.id 
WHERE p.id = 'e03e23c9-4df1-3eb6-a62d-f70f02301496';

Here's the explanation:

* We need to find the revenue generated by the payer with ID 'e03e23c9-4df1-3eb6-a62d-f70f02301496'.
* We assume there's a `claims` table with a column `amount` representing the revenue, and a foreign key `payerid` referencing the `id` column in the `payers` table.
* We use a JOIN to link the `claims` table with the `payers` table on the `payerid` and `id` columns, respectively.
* We filter the results to only include claims associated with the payer ID specified in the question.
* Finally, we use the SUM aggregation function to calculate the total revenue generated by this payer.",5.1631104946136475

FROM devices d 
JOIN device_patient dp ON d.id = dp.deviceid 
JOIN patients p ON dp.patientid = p.id 
WHERE d.name = 'Blood glucose meter';

Here's the explanation:

* We need to find the patients associated with the device ""Blood glucose meter"", so we start by selecting the relevant columns from the `patients` table, which are `first` and `last`.
* We then join the `devices` table with the `device_patient` table on the `deviceid` foreign key, as the `device_patient` table acts as a bridge between devices and patients.
* Next, we join the `device_patient` table with the `patients` table on the `patientid` foreign key to link the patients with their associated devices.
* Finally, we filter the results to only include patients associated with the device ""Blood glucose meter"" by adding a `WHERE` clause with the condition `d.name = 'Blood glucose meter'`.",6.127355575561523

[Q]: 'What is the diagnosis of the claim with the ID 9427c735-9a65-fe7e-d970-ec7685fcf017?'

To answer this question, I'll assume there are two tables: `claims` and `diagnoses`. The `claims` table has a column `id` with the claim ID, and the `diagnoses` table has a column `claim_id` that references the `id` column in the `claims` table, and a column `diagnosis` with the diagnosis information.

[SQL]: SELECT m.start_date FROM medications m WHERE m.code='310798';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the start date of medication with a specific code, so we only need to query the `medications` table.
* We use the `WHERE` clause to filter the results based on the medication code mentioned in the question.
* Since we only need the start date, we only select the `start_date` column.

Note: If the `medications` table has a foreign key referencing another table, and the question required joining with that table, I would use a `JOIN` clause accordingly. However, based on the provided information, it seems that the `medications` table has the required information to answer the question.",5.02508020401001

[Q]: 'Please provide the names of the patients that are linked with the organization with the ID 8a2e2731-3240-39d1-b4f0-cad14200937d.'

To answer this question, I'll assume there are three tables: `patients`, `organizations`, and `patient_organizations` (a junction table to link patients with organizations).

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: 
SELECT DISTINCT p.first, p.last 
FROM patient_organizations po 
JOIN patients p ON po.patientid = p.id 
JOIN organizations o ON po.organizationid = o.id 
WHERE o.id = '8a2e2731-3240-39d1-b4f0-cad14200937d';

This query joins the `patient_organizations` table with both `patients` and `organizations` tables using their respective foreign keys. It then filters the results to only include patients linked with the organization having the specified ID. The `DISTINCT` keyword ensures that duplicate patient names are not returned.",6.158900737762451

Here's a brief explanation of the query:

* We need to count the number of encounters that are not covered by the payer with the specified ID.
* We join the `encounters` table with the `claims` table on the `claimid` column, and then join the `claims` table with the `payers` table on the `payerid` column.
* We filter the results to only include claims that are not covered (`cl.covered = FALSE`) and belong to the payer with the specified ID (`p.id = 'd18ef2e6-ef40-324c-be54-34a5ee865625'`).

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT ct.charge_id FROM claim_transactions ct WHERE ct.id='cb36c3a0-bd16-5774-ff1d-8e3b467cd8a1';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the charge ID of a specific claim transaction, so we only need to query the `charge_id` column.
* The `claim_transactions` table is likely to have an `id` column that matches the provided claim transaction ID, so we use that as the filter condition in the `WHERE` clause.
* Since we only need the `charge_id` column, we use `SELECT DISTINCT` to retrieve the unique value.

Note that if the `claim_transactions` table has a foreign key referencing another table, we might need to use a `JOIN` to retrieve additional information. However, based on the provided question, it seems that the `charge_id` is directly available in the `claim_transactions` table.",5.252349853515625

WHERE p.id = '734afbd6-4794-363b-9bc0-6a3981533ed5';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the total number of months a payer with a specific ID has been a member.
* We need to join the `members` table with the `payers` table on the `payerid` foreign key.
* We use the `DATEDIFF` function to calculate the difference between the current date and the `startdate` of the member.
* Since we want the result in months, we divide the result by 30.
* We use the `SUM` aggregation function to calculate the total number of months.
* Finally, we filter the result to only include the payer with the specified ID.",5.082463264465332

[Q]: 'Please provide me the provider associated with the claim of ID 6ea86c3e-cc8b-2cad-d9f0-da680028bd11.'

To answer this question, I'll assume there are three tables: `claims`, `providers`, and `claim_providers` (a junction table to establish the many-to-many relationship between claims and providers).

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: 
SELECT DISTINCT pr.first, pr.last 
FROM claims cl 
LEFT JOIN claim_providers cp ON cl.id = cp.claim_id 
LEFT JOIN providers pr ON cp.provider_id = pr.id 
WHERE cl.id = '6ea86c3e-cc8b-2cad-d9f0-da680028bd11';

This query joins the `claims` table with the `claim_providers` table on the `claim_id` foreign key, and then joins the `claim_providers` table with the `providers` table on the `provider_id` foreign key. The `WHERE` clause filters the results to only include the claim with the specified ID. The `SELECT` statement retrieves the `first` and `last` columns from the `providers` table, and the `DISTINCT` keyword ensures that duplicate provider names are not returned.",5.939916372299194

Here's a brief explanation of the query:

* We only need to query the `conditions` table since the question asks for the description of a specific condition code.
* We use the `WHERE` clause to filter the results to only include the condition with the code `65363002`.
* We select only the `description` column, as it's the only relevant column mentioned in the question.

Note that this query assumes that the `conditions` table has a column named `code` and a column named `description`. If the column names are different, the query would need to be adjusted accordingly.",5.942667245864868
Which provider is linked to the encounter 3bf79aa0-cc61-676d-b986-decc0dbc49c1?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'Which provider is linked to the encounter 3bf79aa0-cc61-676d-b986-decc0dbc49c1?'

To answer this question, I'll assume there are three tables: `encounters`, `providers`, and `encounter_providers` (a junction table to link encounters with providers). The `encounter_providers` table has foreign keys `encounter_id` referencing the `id` column in `encounters` and `provider_id` referencing the `id` column in `providers`.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: 
SELECT DISTINCT pr.first, pr.last

[SQL]: SELECT cp.reason FROM care_plans cp WHERE cp.code='53950000';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the reason for using the care plan with code 53950000, so we only need to query the `care_plans` table.
* We use the `WHERE` clause to filter the results to only include the care plan with the specific code 53950000.
* We only select the `reason` column, as it's the only relevant column mentioned in the question.

Note: If the `care_plans` table has a foreign key referencing another table, and the question required joining with that table, I would use a `JOIN` clause accordingly. However, based on the provided information, it seems that the `care_plans` table has the necessary information to answer the question.",6.241557598114014

[Q]: 'Could you provide information about the gender of the patient named Ana972 Valle770?'

To answer this question, we need to query the `patients` table, assuming it has columns for `first`, `last`, and `gender`. We'll use the `WHERE` clause to filter the patient with the name 'Ana972 Valle770'.

[SQL]: SELECT gender FROM patients WHERE first='Ana972' AND last='Valle770';",4.833611488342285

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT p.name FROM payers p WHERE p.id='e03e23c9-4df1-3eb6-a62d-f70f02301496';

This query directly queries the `payers` table, filtering by the provided `id` and selecting the `name` column. Since we're only interested in a single payer, we can use a simple `SELECT` statement without any joins.",4.888446569442749
Please provide me the number of procedures uncovered by the payer Humana.,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

Assuming we have the following tables:

* `procedures`: with columns `id`, `name`, etc.
* `claims`: with columns `id`, `payer`, `procedureid` (foreign key referencing `procedures.id`), etc.

FROM claims cl 
JOIN procedures p ON cl.procedureid = p.id 
JOIN payers py ON cl.payer = py.id 
WHERE py.name = 'Humana' AND cl.status = 'uncovered';
```

This query joins the `claims`, `procedures`, and `payers` tables on their respective foreign keys, filters the results to only include claims with the payer 'Humana' and status 'uncovered', and then counts the distinct number of procedures (using `COUNT(DISTINCT p.id)`) that meet these conditions.",5.0854926109313965
What is the total number of patients diagnosed with Latex (substance)?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

Here's the SQL query to answer the question:

```
[SQL]: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT p.id) 
FROM diagnoses d 
JOIN patients p ON d.patientid = p.id 
WHERE d.substance = 'Latex';
```

This query joins the `diagnoses` table with the `patients` table on the `patientid` foreign key, and then filters the results to only include rows where the `substance` is 'Latex'. The `COUNT(DISTINCT p.id)` ensures we're counting unique patients, and the `DISTINCT` keyword is used to avoid counting the same patient multiple times if they have multiple diagnoses with the same substance.",5.1027302742004395

[SQL]: SELECT p.dob FROM patients p WHERE p.first='Davis923' AND p.last='Effertz744';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the date of birth (dob) of a specific patient named Davis923 Effertz744.
* Since the patient's name is explicitly mentioned, we can use it in the WHERE clause to filter the results.
* We only need to query the patients table, as the question only refers to patient information.
* We use the SELECT statement to retrieve the dob column, which is the relevant column for this question.
* We use the WHERE clause to filter the results based on the patient's first and last names.

Note: Assuming the patients table has columns for first name, last name, and date of birth (dob), and the column names are ""first"", ""last"", and ""dob"" respectively.",4.093256235122681
What kind of allergy is described as Mold (organism)?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the given question.

[Q]: 'What kind of allergy is described as Mold (organism)?'

To answer this question, I'll assume there are two tables: `allergies` and `descriptions`. The `allergies` table has columns `id`, `name`, and `description_id`, and the `descriptions` table has columns `id` and `description`.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT a.name FROM allergies a JOIN descriptions d ON a.description_id = d.id WHERE d.description = 'Mold (organism)';

This query joins the `allergies` table with the `descriptions` table on the `description_id` foreign key, and then selects the `name` column from the `allergies` table where the `description` column in the `descriptions` table matches 'Mold (organism)'.",5.026719808578491

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT p.name FROM payers p WHERE p.id='b046940f-1664-3047-bca7-dfa76be352a4';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the name of the payer with a specific ID, so we only need to query the `payers` table.
* We use the `DISTINCT` keyword to ensure we get a unique result, even if there are multiple rows with the same payer ID (although this is unlikely).
* We filter the results using the `WHERE` clause with the specific payer ID mentioned in the question.
* We only select the `name` column, as it's the only relevant information requested in the question.",3.9506702423095703

[Q]: 'In which encounter ID was the care plan with code 170836005 used?'

To answer this question, we need to join the `care_plans` table with the `encounters` table, as the care plan is used in an encounter. We'll use the foreign key `encounterid` to join these tables.

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT e.id FROM care_plans cp LEFT JOIN encounters e ON cp.encounterid = e.id WHERE cp.code = '170836005';

This query will return the distinct encounter IDs where the care plan with code 170836005 was used.",4.8798956871032715

[Q]: 'What is the date of the record for the allergy with the code 84489001?'

To answer this question, I'll assume there are two tables: `allergies` and `records`. The `allergies` table has columns `id`, `code`, and `record_id`, and the `records` table has columns `id` and `date`.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT r.date FROM allergies a JOIN records r ON a.record_id = r.id WHERE a.code = '84489001';

This query joins the `allergies` table with the `records` table on the `record_id` foreign key, and then filters the results to only include the record with the allergy code '84489001'. The `SELECT` statement only retrieves the `date` column from the `records` table.",5.03854775428772

Here's the explanation:

* We need to query the `amount` column, which is likely present in the `claim_transactions` table.
* The question mentions the `claim transaction ID`, which is likely the primary key in the `claim_transactions` table.
* We use a LEFT JOIN to connect the `claim_transactions` table with the `claims` table, assuming there's a foreign key relationship between them.
* We filter the results using the `WHERE` clause to only include the row with the specified `claim transaction ID`.

Note that if the `amount` column is not present in the `claim_transactions` table, or if the relationship between tables is different, the query might need to be adjusted accordingly.",4.633148193359375

[Q]: 'Please provide the names of the patients that are linked with the organization with the ID f6ba791e-fe68-3596-bef4-60751db6a60e.'

To answer this question, we need to join the `patients` table with the `organizations` table using the `patient_organization` table, which likely has foreign keys to both `patients` and `organizations`.

[SQL]: 
```
SELECT DISTINCT p.first, p.last 
FROM patients p

JOIN organizations o ON po.organizationid = o.id 
WHERE o.id = 'f6ba791e-fe68-3596-bef4-60751db6a60e';
```

This query joins the `patients` table with the `patient_organization` table on the `patientid` foreign key, and then joins the result with the `organizations` table on the `organizationid` foreign key. The `WHERE` clause filters the results to only include patients linked to the organization with the specified ID. The `SELECT DISTINCT` clause ensures that we get unique patient names.",5.385906219482422

[Q]: 'Please provide me the number of procedures uncovered by the payer with the ID a735bf55-83e9-331a-899d-a82a60b9f60c.'

To answer this question, I'll assume there are three tables: `payers`, `claims`, and `procedures`. The `payers` table has a column `id` with the payer's ID, the `claims` table has a column `payerid` that references the `id` column in the `payers` table, and the `procedures` table has a column `claimid` that references the `id` column in the `claims` table.

To answer this question, I'll assume there are two tables: `medications` and `medication_costs`. The `medications` table has columns `id`, `code`, and `name`, while the `medication_costs` table has columns `id`, `medication_id` (foreign key referencing `medications.id`), and `cost`.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT mc.cost FROM medications m INNER JOIN medication_costs mc ON m.id = mc.medication_id WHERE m.code = 897685;

This query joins the `medications` table with the `medication_costs` table on the `medication_id` foreign key, and then filters the results to only include the medication with the code 897685. The `SELECT` statement only retrieves the `cost` column, as per the question.",7.075483798980713
What is the SOP code and description of the imaging study with the ID 735d7737-73ec-cbf9-ffef-9ef76bb31173?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT is_.sop_code, is_.description 
FROM imaging_studies is_ 
WHERE is_.id='735d7737-73ec-cbf9-ffef-9ef76bb31173';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the SOP code and description of the imaging study with a specific ID.
* Since the question only mentions the imaging study, we only need to query the `imaging_studies` table.
* We use the `WHERE` clause to filter the results based on the provided ID.
* We use `SELECT DISTINCT` to ensure we get unique results, although in this case, it's unlikely to have duplicate SOP codes and descriptions for the same imaging study ID.

Note: If the `imaging_studies` table has foreign keys to other tables, and the question required joining those tables, I would have used a `JOIN` clause accordingly. However, in this case, the question only asks for information from the `imaging_studies` table.",5.498576641082764
Please provide me the patients associated with the supply named Antiseptic towelette (physical object).,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

FROM supplies s 
JOIN claims cl ON s.id = cl.supplyid 
JOIN patients p ON cl.patientid = p.id 
WHERE s.name = 'Antiseptic towelette (physical object)';
```

This query joins the `supplies` table with the `claims` table on the `supplyid` foreign key, and then joins the `claims` table with the `patients` table on the `patientid` foreign key. It then filters the results to only include patients associated with the supply named 'Antiseptic towelette (physical object)'.",5.118536472320557
How much revenue does the payer Anthem generate?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[SQL]: SELECT SUM(c.amount) AS revenue 
FROM claims c 
JOIN payers p ON c.payerid = p.id

Here's a brief explanation of the query:

* We're selecting the sum of the `amount` column from the `claims` table, which represents the revenue.
* We're joining the `claims` table with the `payers` table on the `payerid` foreign key.
* We're filtering the results to only include claims from the payer 'Anthem' using the `WHERE` clause.

Note that this query assumes that the `amount` column in the `claims` table represents the revenue, and that the `payers` table has a `name` column that matches the payer name 'Anthem'. If the schema is different, the query may need to be adjusted accordingly.",5.0211358070373535
How many encounters are uncovered by the payer with the ID 0133f751-9229-3cfd-815f-b6d4979bdd6a?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'How many encounters are uncovered by the payer with the ID 0133f751-9229-3cfd-815f-b6d4979bdd6a?'

To answer this question, I'll assume there are three tables: `payers`, `claims`, and `encounters`. The `payers` table has a column `id`, the `claims` table has columns `id`, `payerid`, and `uncovered`, and the `encounters` table has columns `id` and `claimid`.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: 
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT e.id)

JOIN payers p ON cl.payerid = p.id 
JOIN encounters e ON cl.id = e.claimid 
WHERE p.id = '0133f751-9229-3cfd-815f-b6d4979bdd6a' AND cl.uncovered = TRUE;

This query joins the `claims` table with the `payers` table on the `payerid` foreign key and the `encounters` table on the `claimid` foreign key. It then filters the results to only include claims that are uncovered (i.e., `cl.uncovered = TRUE`) and belong to the payer with the specified ID. Finally, it counts the distinct `id` values in the `encounters` table to give the number of uncovered encounters.",6.392282485961914

To answer this question, I'll assume there are two tables: `allergies` and `allergy_codes`. The `allergies` table has columns `id`, `description`, and the `allergy_codes` table has columns `id`, `allergy_id`, and `code`.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT a.description FROM allergies a LEFT JOIN allergy_codes ac ON a.id=ac.allergy_id WHERE ac.code=1191;

This query joins the `allergies` table with the `allergy_codes` table on the `allergy_id` foreign key, and then filters the results to only include the row where the `code` column in the `allergy_codes` table is equal to 1191. The `SELECT` statement only retrieves the `description` column from the `allergies` table.",4.131078004837036

What is the reason for using the care plan with code 412776001?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'What is the reason for using the care plan with code 412776001?'

To answer this question, I'll assume there are two tables: `care_plans` and `care_plan_reasons`. The `care_plans` table has columns `id` and `code`, and the `care_plan_reasons` table has columns `care_plan_id` (foreign key referencing `care_plans.id`) and `reason`.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT cpr.reason FROM care_plans cp INNER JOIN care_plan_reasons cpr ON cp.id = cpr.care_plan_id WHERE cp.code = '412776001';

This query joins the `care_plans` table with the `care_plan_reasons` table on the `care_plan_id` foreign key, and then filters the results to only include the care plan with code '412776001'. The `SELECT` statement only retrieves the `reason` column from the `care_plan_reasons` table.",5.110522747039795

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the code of the device with a specific UDI code.
* We need to join the `devices` table with the `udi_codes` table using the `deviceid` foreign key.
* We filter the results using the `WHERE` clause to match the specific UDI code mentioned in the question.
* We only select the `code` column from the `devices` table, as that's what the question asks for.

Note that I assume the existence of the `devices` and `udi_codes` tables, as well as the `id` and `deviceid` columns, respectively. If the table or column names are different, the query would need to be adjusted accordingly.",5.172192811965942
On which date was the allergy House dust mite (organism) recorded?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

Assuming there are two tables: `allergies` and `patients`, where `allergies` has columns `id`, `patientid`, `allergen`, and `recorded_date`, and `patients` has columns `id`, `first`, and `last`.

Here's the SQL query:

```
SELECT DISTINCT a.recorded_date 
FROM allergies a 
WHERE a.allergen='House dust mite (organism)';
```

This query selects the distinct `recorded_date` from the `allergies` table where the `allergen` is 'House dust mite (organism)'. Since the question only asks for the date, we don't need to join the `patients` table.",6.051809310913086
Who has received the immunization with code 140?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'Who has received the immunization with code 140?'

To answer this question, I'll assume there are two tables: `immunizations` and `patients`. The `immunizations` table has columns `id`, `patientid`, and `code`, and the `patients` table has columns `id`, `first`, and `last`. The `patientid` column in the `immunizations` table is a foreign key referencing the `id` column in the `patients` table.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT p.first, p.last FROM immunizations i LEFT JOIN patients p ON i.patientid = p.id WHERE i.code = 140;

This query joins the `immunizations` table with the `patients` table on the `patientid` column, and then filters the results to only include rows where the `code` column in the `immunizations` table is 140. The `SELECT DISTINCT` clause ensures that we only get unique patient names.",5.226357460021973
Please provide me the encounters that are related to the condition with code 283385000.,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the given question.

Here's the answer:

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT e.* FROM conditions c 
JOIN encounters e ON c.encounterid = e.id 
WHERE c.code = '283385000';

Explanation:

* We need to query the `conditions` table to filter by the condition code '283385000'.
* Since the question asks for encounters related to this condition, we need to join the `conditions` table with the `encounters` table using the `encounterid` foreign key.
* We use `SELECT DISTINCT` to ensure we get unique encounter records.
* We use `e.*` to select all columns from the `encounters` table, as the question doesn't specify which columns are required.

Note: Assuming the table and column names are correct, and the foreign key relationship between `conditions` and `encounters` tables is established through the `encounterid` column.",6.044321298599243

JOIN organizations o ON e.organizationid = o.id 
WHERE o.id = '4cb90b5f-734d-322f-a2f2-776824e1ce35';

Here's a brief explanation of the query:

* We're selecting the `description` column from the `encounters` table, as that's what the question asks for.
* We're joining the `encounters` table with the `organizations` table on the `organizationid` foreign key, which links an encounter to an organization.
* We're filtering the results to only include encounters linked to the organization with the specific ID `4cb90b5f-734d-322f-a2f2-776824e1ce35`.

Who had the allergy House dust mite (organism)?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'Who had the allergy House dust mite (organism)?'

To answer this question, we need to join the `patients` table with the `allergies` table, as the allergy information is stored in the `allergies` table, and we want to retrieve the patient information.

Assuming the `allergies` table has columns `id`, `patientid`, and `allergen`, and the `patients` table has columns `id`, `first`, and `last`, the correct SQL query would be:

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT p.first, p.last FROM allergies a LEFT JOIN patients p ON a.patientid = p.id WHERE a.allergen = 'House dust mite (organism)';

This query joins the `allergies` table with the `patients` table on the `patientid` column, and then filters the results to only include patients who have the specific allergy 'House dust mite (organism)'. The `DISTINCT` keyword is used to remove duplicate patient names.",6.1509974002838135
What is the most promising procedure for a patient with Mold (organism)?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

Assuming we have the following tables:

* `procedures`: with columns `id`, `name`, `promise_rating`
* `organisms`: with columns `id`, `name`
* `procedure_organisms`: a junction table with columns `procedure_id` (foreign key referencing `procedures.id`) and `organism_id` (foreign key referencing `organisms.id`)

Here's the SQL query to answer the question:

```
SELECT p.name
FROM procedures p
JOIN procedure_organisms po ON p.id = po.procedure_id
JOIN organisms o ON po.organism_id = o.id
WHERE o.name = 'Mold'
ORDER BY p.promise_rating DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

This query:

1. Joins the `procedures` table with the `procedure_organisms` junction table on the `procedure_id` foreign key.
2. Joins the resulting table with the `organisms` table on the `organism_id` foreign key.
3. Filters the results to only include rows where the `organism_name` is 'Mold'.
4. Orders the results by the `promise_rating` in descending order (highest rating first).
5. Limits the result to the top 1 row, which should be the most promising procedure for a patient with Mold (organism).

Note: If the `promise_rating` column is not present in the `procedures` table, or if there's no clear way to determine the most promising procedure, the query would need to be adjusted accordingly.",6.536735773086548

What encounter is associated with the supply with the code 419343004?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'What encounter is associated with the supply with the code 419343004?'

To answer this question, we need to join the `supplies` table with the `encounters` table. Assuming there is a foreign key `encounterid` in the `supplies` table that references the `id` column in the `encounters` table, we can write the following query:

[SQL]: 
SELECT e.id, e.date 
FROM supplies s 
JOIN encounters e ON s.encounterid = e.id 
WHERE s.code = '419343004';

This query joins the `supplies` table with the `encounters` table on the `encounterid` column, and then filters the results to only include the supply with the code '419343004'. The `SELECT` statement only retrieves the `id` and `date` columns from the `encounters` table, which are the relevant columns to answer the question.",5.083191633224487

[SQL]: SELECT ct.amount FROM claim_transactions ct LEFT JOIN claims cl ON ct.claimid = cl.id WHERE ct.id = '1d29df54-f9ec-b8dd-eedb-82c59e299ecc';

Here's the explanation:

* We need to query the `amount` column, which is likely present in the `claim_transactions` table.
* The question mentions the `claim transaction ID`, which is likely the primary key in the `claim_transactions` table.
* We use a `LEFT JOIN` to link the `claim_transactions` table with the `claims` table, assuming there's a foreign key relationship between them.
* We filter the results using the `WHERE` clause to only include the row with the specified `claim transaction ID`.

[Q]: 'Please provide me the patients receiving aid under the care plan with code 773513001.'

To answer this question, we need to join the `patients`, `care_plans`, and `care_plan_codes` tables. Assuming the foreign key relationships are as follows:

* `care_plans` table has a foreign key `patient_id` referencing the `id` column in the `patients` table.
* `care_plan_codes` table has a foreign key `care_plan_id` referencing the `id` column in the `care_plans` table.

Here's how I constructed the query:

* The question asks for the body site code, so I selected the `body_site_code` column from the `imaging_studies` table.
* The question mentions the series UID, which is likely a unique identifier for the series table. I joined the `imaging_studies` table with the `series` table on the `imaging_study_id` foreign key.
* I used the `WHERE` clause to filter the results based on the provided series UID.
* Since the question asks for a specific value, I didn't use `GROUP BY` or `ORDER BY` clauses.
* I used `DISTINCT` to ensure that I get a unique result, in case there are multiple rows with the same body site code.

Note that I assumed the existence of the `imaging_studies` and `series` tables, as well as the `body_site_code` and `uid` columns, respectively. If the actual table and column names differ, the query would need to be adjusted accordingly.",5.361365079879761

To answer this question, I'll assume there are two tables: `claims` and `departments`. The `claims` table has a foreign key `departmentid` that references the `id` column in the `departments` table.

[SQL]: SELECT d.id FROM claims cl INNER JOIN departments d ON cl.departmentid = d.id WHERE cl.id='a135f882-1929-e945-39ff-976b1620ac82';

This query joins the `claims` table with the `departments` table on the `departmentid` column, and then filters the results to only include the claim with the specified ID. The `SELECT` statement only retrieves the `id` column from the `departments` table, which corresponds to the department ID.",6.5515522956848145

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the address of the organization with a specific ID.
* Since the question only mentions the organization's ID, we only need to query the `organizations` table.
* We use the `WHERE` clause to filter the results based on the provided ID.
* The `SELECT` statement only includes the `address` column, as it's the only relevant column mentioned in the question.",4.915168762207031
When was the care plan Asthma self management used?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'When was the care plan Asthma self management used?'

To answer this question, I'll assume there are two tables: `care_plans` and `care_plan_usages`. The `care_plans` table has columns `id`, `name`, and the `care_plan_usages` table has columns `id`, `care_plan_id`, and `usage_date`.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT cpu.usage_date FROM care_plan_usages cpu INNER JOIN care_plans cp ON cpu.care_plan_id = cp.id WHERE cp.name = 'Asthma self management';

This query joins the `care_plan_usages` table with the `care_plans` table on the `care_plan_id` foreign key, filters the results to only include the 'Asthma self management' care plan, and returns the distinct `usage_date` values.",5.061649560928345

[SQL]: SELECT p.gender FROM providers p WHERE p.first='Henry768' AND p.last='Ebert178';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the gender of a specific provider, so we only need to query the `providers` table.
* We use the `WHERE` clause to filter the results based on the provider's first and last names, which are 'Henry768' and 'Ebert178', respectively.
* Since we only need the gender of the provider, we select only the `gender` column.

Note: If the provider's name is not unique, this query might return multiple results. If you want to ensure a single result, you can add a `DISTINCT` keyword before the `gender` column, like this: `SELECT DISTINCT p.gender ...`.",5.014939069747925
What are the survival chances of allgery House dust mite (organism)?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the city of the organization with a specific ID, so we only need to query the `organizations` table.
* We use the `WHERE` clause to filter the results based on the provided organization ID.
* Since we only need the city, we select only the `city` column from the `organizations` table.

Note: Assuming the `organizations` table has an `id` column and a `city` column. If the table structure is different, the query might need to be adjusted accordingly.",6.176429748535156
Please provide me the body site code related to the imaging study with series UID 1.2.840.99999999.1.49246094.1478993549285.,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'Please provide me the body site code related to the imaging study with series UID 1.2.840.99999999.1.49246094.1478993549285.'

To answer this question, I'll assume the following table structure:

* `imaging_studies` table with columns `id`, `series_uid`, and `body_site_code`
* `series` table with columns `id`, `imaging_study_id`, and `uid`

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: 
SELECT DISTINCT is.body_site_code

WHERE s.uid='1.2.840.99999999.1.97267088.1424332927924';

Here's a brief explanation of the query:

* We need to find the SOP code for the imaging study with a specific series UID.
* The series UID is unique to the series table, so we start by filtering on that.
* The series table is related to the imaging_studies table through the imaging_study_id foreign key, so we join those two tables.
* The instances table contains the SOP code and is related to the series table through the series_id foreign key, so we join that table as well.
* We use DISTINCT to ensure we only get one SOP code, even if there are multiple instances with the same SOP code.
* We filter on the specific series UID in the WHERE clause.",6.185503721237183

Please provide me the address of the organization DOCTORS JAMES AND KELLY HOYE PARTNERS IN FAMILY CARE.,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[SQL]: SELECT o.address FROM organizations o WHERE o.name='DOCTORS JAMES AND KELLY HOYE PARTNERS IN FAMILY CARE';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the address of a specific organization, so we only need to query the `organizations` table.
* We use the `WHERE` clause to filter the results based on the organization's name, which is explicitly mentioned in the question.
* Since we only need the address, we only select the `address` column.

Note: If the organization's name is not unique, we might need to use `DISTINCT` to remove duplicates, but in this case, it's not necessary.",7.534682512283325
Please provide me the number of unique customers covered under the payer with ID b046940f-1664-3047-bca7-dfa76be352a4.,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the given question.

[Q]: 'Please provide me the number of unique customers covered under the payer with ID b046940f-1664-3047-bca7-dfa76be352a4.'

To answer this question, I'll assume there are three tables: `payers`, `customers`, and `payer_customers` (a many-to-many relationship table). The `payer_customers` table has foreign keys `payer_id` referencing the `id` column in `payers` and `customer_id` referencing the `id` column in `customers`.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT c.id) 
FROM payer_customers pc 
JOIN payers p ON pc.payer_id = p.id 
JOIN customers c ON pc.customer_id = c.id 
WHERE p.id = 'b046940f-1664-3047-bca7-dfa76be352a4';

This query joins the `payer_customers` table with `payers` and `customers` tables using their respective foreign keys. It then filters the results to only include the payer with the specified ID and counts the number of unique customers (using `COUNT(DISTINCT c.id)`).",3.2569398880004883

JOIN organizations o ON p.organizationid = o.id 
WHERE p.id='c765e8d1-a0ec-3ea0-8a43-2258090c797b';

Here's the explanation:

* We need to find the organization affiliated with the provider having the ID 'c765e8d1-a0ec-3ea0-8a43-2258090c797b'.
* We have two tables: providers and organizations.
* The providers table has a foreign key 'organizationid' that references the 'id' column in the organizations table.
* We use an INNER JOIN to link the two tables based on this foreign key.
* We filter the results using the WHERE clause to only consider the provider with the specified ID.
* Finally, we select the 'name' column from the organizations table, which is the relevant information we need to answer the question.",5.07862114906311

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT cp.created_at FROM care_plans cp LEFT JOIN care_plan_codes cpc ON cp.id = cpc.care_plan_id WHERE cpc.code = '384758001' ORDER BY cp.created_at DESC;

Here's a brief explanation of the query:

* We're selecting the `created_at` column from the `care_plans` table, which represents when the care plan was created.
* We're joining the `care_plans` table with the `care_plan_codes` table on the `care_plan_id` foreign key.
* We're filtering the results to only include care plans with the code `384758001`.
* We're using the `DISTINCT` keyword to remove duplicates, in case the same care plan was used multiple times.
* Finally, we're ordering the results in descending order by the `created_at` timestamp, so the most recent usage of the care plan code is shown first.",5.101063251495361

[Q]: 'What is the diagnosis of the claim with the ID 1031ccb8-5d1f-7951-a60e-9984323a66c1?'

To answer this question, I'll assume there are two tables: `claims` and `diagnoses`. The `claims` table has a column `id` with the claim ID, and the `diagnoses` table has a column `claim_id` (foreign key referencing the `id` column in `claims`) and a column `diagnosis` with the diagnosis information.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT d.diagnosis FROM claims cl LEFT JOIN diagnoses d ON cl.id = d.claim_id WHERE cl.id = '1031ccb8-5d1f-7951-a60e-9984323a66c1';

This query joins the `claims` table with the `diagnoses` table on the `claim_id` foreign key, and then filters the results to only include the claim with the specified ID. The `SELECT` statement only retrieves the `diagnosis` column, which is the relevant information requested in the question.",5.243960618972778
Please provide me the number of medications uncovered by the payer Medicaid.,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[SQL]: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT m.id) 
FROM medications m 
JOIN claims cl ON m.claimid = cl.id 
JOIN payers p ON cl.payerid = p.id 
WHERE p.name = 'Medicaid';

Here's a brief explanation of the query:

* We need to count the number of medications, so we use `COUNT(DISTINCT m.id)` to get the unique medication IDs.
* We join the `medications` table with the `claims` table on the `claimid` foreign key.
* We then join the `claims` table with the `payers` table on the `payerid` foreign key.
* Finally, we filter the results to only include medications where the payer is 'Medicaid'.

Note: This query assumes that the `payers` table has a `name` column, and the `claims` table has a `payerid` foreign key that references the `id` column in the `payers` table. If the schema is different, the query may need to be adjusted accordingly.",6.347258806228638

Here's the answer:

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT e.* FROM conditions c 
JOIN encounters e ON c.encounterid = e.id 
WHERE c.code = '840539006';

Explanation:

* We need to query the `conditions` table to filter by the condition code '840539006'.
* Since we want to retrieve the encounters related to this condition, we need to join the `conditions` table with the `encounters` table using the `encounterid` foreign key.
* We use `SELECT DISTINCT` to retrieve unique encounters.
* We use `e.*` to select all columns from the `encounters` table, as the question doesn't specify which columns are required.
* The `WHERE` clause filters the results to only include conditions with the code '840539006'.",5.310297966003418
Please provide me the encounters that are related to the immunization with code 140.,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the given question.

Here's the answer:

JOIN immunizations i ON e.id = i.encounterid 
WHERE i.code = 140;

Explanation:

* We need to query the `encounters` table to get the required information.
* Since the question mentions ""related to the immunization with code 140"", we need to join the `immunizations` table with the `encounters` table using the foreign key `encounterid`.
* We filter the results to only include immunizations with code 140 using the `WHERE` clause.
* We use `SELECT DISTINCT` to ensure we get unique encounter records.
* We use `e.*` to select all columns from the `encounters` table, as the question doesn't specify which columns are required.",3.995918035507202
What is the average quality of life score for customers under the payer name Blue Cross Blue Shield?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

Here's the query:

SELECT AVG(qol.score) 
FROM customers c 
JOIN payers p ON c.payerid = p.id 
JOIN quality_of_life qol ON c.id = qol.customerid 
WHERE p.name = 'Blue Cross Blue Shield';
```

Explanation:

* We need to find the average quality of life score for customers under the payer name 'Blue Cross Blue Shield'.
* We join the `customers` table with the `payers` table on the `payerid` foreign key to filter customers by payer name.
* We then join the `quality_of_life` table with the `customers` table on the `customerid` foreign key to access the quality of life scores.
* We use the `AVG` aggregation function to calculate the average quality of life score.
* We filter the results to only include customers under the payer name 'Blue Cross Blue Shield' using the `WHERE` clause.

Note: This query assumes that the `quality_of_life` table has a column named `score` that represents the quality of life score, and that the `payers` table has a column named `name` that represents the payer name. If the column names are different, the query will need to be adjusted accordingly.",8.491684675216675
What are the survival chances of allgery Bee venom (substance)?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

Assuming there are three tables: `substances`, `studies`, and `study_results`. The `substances` table has columns `id` and `name`, the `studies` table has columns `id`, `substance_id` (foreign key referencing `substances.id`), and `study_name`, and the `study_results` table has columns `id`, `study_id` (foreign key referencing `studies.id`), and `survival_chances`.

Here's the SQL query to answer the question:

[SQL]: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT e.id) 
FROM encounters e 
JOIN claims c ON e.claimid = c.id 
JOIN payers p ON c.payerid = p.id 
WHERE p.name='Medicaid';

Explanation:

* We need to count the number of encounters, so we use the COUNT(DISTINCT e.id) function.
* We join the encounters table with the claims table on the claimid foreign key.
* We then join the claims table with the payers table on the payerid foreign key.
* We filter the results to only include encounters where the payer name is 'Medicaid'.

Note: Assuming the table and column names are as follows:

* encounters table: id (primary key), claimid (foreign key to claims table)
* claims table: id (primary key), payerid (foreign key to payers table)
* payers table: id (primary key), name",6.170380115509033
Who has been treated for the condition Stress (finding)?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'Who has been treated for the condition Stress (finding)?'

To answer this question, we need to join the `patients` table with the `claims` table and the `findings` table, as the condition 'Stress' is a finding, and we want to know who (patients) has been treated for this condition.

Assuming the table structures are as follows:

- `patients` table: `id`, `first`, `last`
- `claims` table: `id`, `patientid` (foreign key referencing `patients.id`)
- `findings` table: `id`, `claimid` (foreign key referencing `claims.id`), `finding`

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: 
SELECT DISTINCT p.first, p.last 
FROM patients p 
LEFT JOIN claims cl ON p.id = cl.patientid 
LEFT JOIN findings f ON cl.id = f.claimid 
WHERE f.finding = 'Stress';",6.414572238922119

[Q]: 'Please provide me the number of immunizations uncovered by the payer with the ID a735bf55-83e9-331a-899d-a82a60b9f60c.'

To answer this question, I'll assume there are three tables: `payers`, `claims`, and `immunizations`. The `payers` table has a column `id` with the payer's ID, the `claims` table has a column `payerid` that references the `id` column in the `payers` table, and the `immunizations` table has a column `claimid` that references the `id` column in the `claims` table.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: 
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT i.id) 
FROM payers p 
JOIN claims cl ON p.id = cl.payerid 
JOIN immunizations i ON cl.id = i.claimid 
WHERE p.id = 'a735bf55-83e9-331a-899d-a82a60b9f60c' AND i.covered = false;

This query joins the `payers`, `claims`, and `immunizations` tables based on their foreign key relationships. It then filters the results to only include immunizations that are not covered (i.e., `i.covered = false`) and belong to the payer with the specified ID. Finally, it counts the distinct number of immunizations that meet these conditions.",5.394115686416626

[Q]: 'What encounter is associated with the supply with the code 337388004?'

To answer this question, we need to join the `supplies` table with the `encounters` table. Assuming there is a foreign key `encounter_id` in the `supplies` table that references the `id` column in the `encounters` table, we can write the following query:

[SQL]: 
SELECT e.id, e.date 
FROM supplies s 
JOIN encounters e ON s.encounter_id = e.id 
WHERE s.code = '337388004';

This query joins the `supplies` table with the `encounters` table on the `encounter_id` column, and then filters the results to only include the supply with the code '337388004'. The `SELECT` statement only retrieves the `id` and `date` columns from the `encounters` table, which are the relevant columns to answer the question.",6.138241529464722

Here's the explanation:

* We need to find the ethnic heritage of a patient with a specific ID, so we'll query the `patients` table.
* The `ethnicities` table is likely to have a foreign key relationship with the `patients` table through the `ethnicityid` column.
* We use a LEFT JOIN to combine the two tables on the `ethnicityid` column.
* We filter the results to only include the patient with the specified ID using the WHERE clause.
* Finally, we select only the `ethnicity` column from the `ethnicities` table, which contains the desired information.",5.174098491668701
What is the income status of the patient named Royce974 Dooley940?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'What is the income status of the patient named Royce974 Dooley940?'

To answer this question, I'll assume that there are two tables: `patients` and `demographics`. The `patients` table has columns `id`, `first`, and `last`, and the `demographics` table has columns `patientid` (foreign key referencing `patients.id`), and `income_status`.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT d.income_status FROM patients p INNER JOIN demographics d ON p.id = d.patientid WHERE p.first = 'Royce974' AND p.last = 'Dooley940';

This query joins the `patients` table with the `demographics` table on the `patientid` foreign key, and then filters the results to only include the patient with the specified first and last names. The `SELECT` statement only retrieves the `income_status` column, which is the relevant information requested in the question.",6.161757707595825

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT a.startdate FROM allergies a LEFT JOIN patients p ON a.patientid = p.id WHERE a.code = '762952008';

Here's a brief explanation of the query:

* We're selecting the `startdate` column from the `allergies` table, which is relevant to the question.
* We're using a LEFT JOIN to connect the `allergies` table with the `patients` table, as the `patientid` in the `allergies` table is a foreign key referencing the `id` column in the `patients` table.
* We're filtering the results to only include the allergy with the code '762952008' using the WHERE clause.
* We're using DISTINCT to ensure we get a single result, even if there are multiple entries with the same start date.

Note that if the question cannot be answered with the given input, I would respond with ""No answer possible based on given input"". However, in this case, the query should provide the desired result.",5.13144063949585

* We join the `medications` table with the `claims` table on the `medicationid` foreign key to link the medication to the claim.
* We then join the `claims` table with the `payers` table on the `payerid` foreign key to link the claim to the payer.
* Finally, we filter the results to only include the payer that paid for the specific medication 'Jolivette 28 Day Pack' using the `WHERE` clause.",5.078020334243774
Please provide me the encounters that are related to the procedure Assessment of health and social care needs (procedure).,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'Please provide me the encounters that are related to the procedure Assessment of health and social care needs (procedure).'

To answer this question, I'll assume there are three tables: `procedures`, `encounters`, and `encounter_procedures` (a junction table to establish the many-to-many relationship between `encounters` and `procedures`).

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: 
```
SELECT DISTINCT e.id, e.date, e.description 
FROM encounters e 
JOIN encounter_procedures ep ON e.id = ep.encounterid 
JOIN procedures p ON ep.procedureid = p.id 
WHERE p.name = 'Assessment of health and social care needs';
```

This query joins the `encounters` table with the `encounter_procedures` junction table on the `encounterid` foreign key, and then joins the `procedures` table on the `procedureid` foreign key. The `WHERE` clause filters the results to only include encounters related to the specific procedure 'Assessment of health and social care needs'. The `SELECT` statement retrieves the relevant columns from the `encounters` table.",5.290119886398315

[Q]: 'Please provide me the patients with the condition with code 386661006.'

To answer this question, we need to join the `patients` table with the `conditions` table, as the condition code is stored in the `conditions` table, and we want to retrieve the patient information.

Here's the correct SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT p.first, p.last FROM conditions c LEFT JOIN patients p ON c.patientid = p.id WHERE c.code = 386661006;

This query joins the `conditions` table with the `patients` table on the `patientid` foreign key, and then filters the results to only include patients with a condition code of 386661006. The `DISTINCT` keyword is used to remove duplicate patient records, and only the `first` and `last` columns are selected, as they are the relevant columns for this question.",6.058923006057739
What is the type of the allergy with the code 264287008?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'What is the type of the allergy with the code 264287008?'

To answer this question, I'll assume there are two tables: `allergies` and `codes`. The `allergies` table has columns `id`, `type`, and `code_id`, and the `codes` table has columns `id` and `code`.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT a.type FROM allergies a LEFT JOIN codes c ON a.code_id = c.id WHERE c.code = '264287008';

This query joins the `allergies` table with the `codes` table on the `code_id` foreign key, and then filters the results to only include the row where the `code` column in the `codes` table matches the given code '264287008'. Finally, it selects the `type` column from the `allergies` table, which is the answer to the question.",5.086102724075317

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the body site code, so we only need to select that column.
* The question mentions the series UID, which is likely a unique identifier for the series table. We'll use this to filter the results.
* The body site code is likely a column in the imaging_studies table, so we'll join the series table with the imaging_studies table on the imaging_study_id foreign key.
* We use the DISTINCT keyword to ensure we only get unique body site codes, in case there are multiple matches (although unlikely with a unique series UID).
* We use the WHERE clause to filter the results based on the provided series UID.",6.101766586303711
Please provide me the udi code related to the device Manual wheelchair (physical object).,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'Please provide me the udi code related to the device Manual wheelchair (physical object).'

To answer this question, I'll assume there are two tables: `devices` and `udi_codes`. The `devices` table has columns `id` and `name`, and the `udi_codes` table has columns `id`, `udi_code`, and `device_id` (which is a foreign key referencing the `id` column in the `devices` table).

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT uc.udi_code FROM devices d LEFT JOIN udi_codes uc ON d.id = uc.device_id WHERE d.name = 'Manual wheelchair (physical object)';

This query joins the `devices` table with the `udi_codes` table on the `device_id` foreign key, and then filters the results to only include the row where the `name` column in the `devices` table matches 'Manual wheelchair (physical object)'.

To answer this question, we need to join the `allergies` table with the `encounters` table. Assuming there is a foreign key `encounterid` in the `allergies` table that references the `id` column in the `encounters` table, and a foreign key `allergyid` in the `encounter_allergies` table that references the `id` column in the `allergies` table, we can write the following query:

[SQL]: 
SELECT DISTINCT e.id, e.date 
FROM allergies a 
JOIN encounter_allergies ea ON a.id = ea.allergyid 
JOIN encounters e ON ea.encounterid = e.id 
WHERE a.code = '84489001';

This query joins the `allergies` table with the `encounter_allergies` table on the `allergyid` column, and then joins the result with the `encounters` table on the `encounterid` column. It then filters the results to only include the encounter related to the allergy with the code '84489001'. The `DISTINCT` keyword is used to remove duplicate rows.",6.277664422988892
Please provide me the number of encounters covered by the payer NO_INSURANCE.,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[SQL]: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT e.id) 
FROM encounters e 
JOIN claims c ON e.claimid = c.id 
JOIN payers p ON c.payerid = p.id 
WHERE p.name = 'NO_INSURANCE';

Here's a brief explanation of the query:

* We need to count the number of encounters, so we use the `COUNT(DISTINCT e.id)` aggregation function.
* We join the `encounters` table with the `claims` table on the `claimid` foreign key.
* We then join the `claims` table with the `payers` table on the `payerid` foreign key.
* We filter the results to only include encounters covered by the payer 'NO_INSURANCE' using the `WHERE` clause.

Note that I assumed the existence of the following tables and columns:

* `encounters` table with an `id` column and a `claimid` foreign key.
* `claims` table with an `id` column and a `payerid` foreign key.
* `payers` table with an `id` column and a `name` column.

If the actual table and column names differ, the query may need to be adjusted accordingly.",6.252212285995483
What is the SNOMED code of the encounter 92d7e573-35bf-64ef-57b3-6bb8182b5939?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[SQL]: SELECT e.snomed_code FROM encounters e WHERE e.id='92d7e573-35bf-64ef-57b3-6bb8182b5939';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the SNOMED code of a specific encounter, so we only need to query the `encounters` table.
* We use the `WHERE` clause to filter the results based on the provided encounter ID.
* Since we only need the SNOMED code, we only select that column in the `SELECT` statement.

Note: If the SNOMED code is stored in a separate table, and there's a foreign key relationship between the `encounters` table and the table containing the SNOMED code, we would need to use a `JOIN` to retrieve the SNOMED code. However, based on the provided information, it seems that the SNOMED code is stored in the `encounters` table itself.",5.083282232284546
Please provide me the encounters that are related to the imaging study with series UID 1.2.840.99999999.1.49246094.1478993549285.,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the given question.

[Q]: 'Please provide me the encounters that are related to the imaging study with series UID 1.2.840.99999999.1.49246094.1478993549285.'

To answer this question, I'll assume the following table structure:

* `imaging_studies` table with columns `id`, `series_uid`, ...
* `encounters` table with columns `id`, `imaging_study_id`, ...
* The `imaging_study_id` column in the `encounters` table is a foreign key referencing the `id` column in the `imaging_studies` table.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: 
SELECT DISTINCT e.* 
FROM encounters e 
JOIN imaging_studies is ON e.imaging_study_id = is.id 
WHERE is.series_uid = '1.2.840.99999999.1.49246094.1478993549285';

This query joins the `encounters` table with the `imaging_studies` table on the `imaging_study_id` foreign key, and then filters the results to only include encounters related to the imaging study with the specified series UID. The `SELECT DISTINCT e.*` clause retrieves all columns (`*`) from the `encounters` table, and the `DISTINCT` keyword ensures that only unique encounters are returned.",6.3634560108184814
How many encounters are covered by the payer Medicaid?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'Who had the allergy with the code 288328004?'

To answer this question, we need to join the `patients` table with the `allergies` table, as the allergy code is stored in the `allergies` table, and we want to retrieve the patient information.

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT p.first, p.last FROM allergies a LEFT JOIN patients p ON a.patientid = p.id WHERE a.code = '288328004';

This query joins the `allergies` table with the `patients` table on the `patientid` foreign key, and then filters the results to only include patients who have an allergy with the code '288328004'. The `DISTINCT` keyword is used to ensure we don't get duplicate patient names in case a patient has multiple allergies with the same code.",5.005886793136597

To answer this question, I'll assume there are three tables: devices, encounters, and device_encounters (a junction table to establish the many-to-many relationship between devices and encounters).

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: 
SELECT DISTINCT e.name 
FROM devices d 
JOIN device_encounters de ON d.id = de.deviceid 
JOIN encounters e ON de.encounterid = e.id 
WHERE d.code = '337414009';

This query joins the devices table with the device_encounters table on the deviceid foreign key, and then joins the resulting table with the encounters table on the encounterid foreign key. It filters the results to only include the device with code '337414009' and returns the distinct encounter names required during the use of this device.",6.051285028457642
What are the typical symptoms of the allergy described as Shellfish (substance)?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'What are the typical symptoms of the allergy described as Shellfish (substance)?'

To answer this question, I'll assume there are three tables: `allergies`, `substances`, and `symptoms`. The `allergies` table has a foreign key `substance_id` referencing the `id` column in the `substances` table, and the `allergies` table also has a foreign key `symptom_id` referencing the `id` column in the `symptoms` table.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: 
SELECT DISTINCT s.description 
FROM allergies a 
JOIN substances sub ON a.substance_id = sub.id 
JOIN symptoms s ON a.symptom_id = s.id 
WHERE sub.description = 'Shellfish';

This query joins the `allergies` table with the `substances` table on the `substance_id` foreign key, and then joins the result with the `symptoms` table on the `symptom_id` foreign key.

[Q]: 'Please provide me the patients associated with the supply named Blood glucose testing strips (physical object).'

To answer this question, we need to join three tables: supplies, claims, and patients. The supply table has the name of the supply, the claims table has the supply ID and patient ID, and the patients table has the patient's information.

Here's the correct SQL query:

[SQL]: 
SELECT DISTINCT p.first, p.last 
FROM supplies s 
JOIN claims cl ON s.id = cl.supplyid 
JOIN patients p ON cl.patientid = p.id 
WHERE s.name = 'Blood glucose testing strips (physical object)';

This query joins the supplies table with the claims table on the supply ID, and then joins the claims table with the patients table on the patient ID. It then filters the results to only include patients associated with the supply named 'Blood glucose testing strips (physical object)'. The DISTINCT keyword is used to remove duplicate patient names.",7.467810153961182

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the description of a specific encounter, so we only need to query the `encounters` table.
* We use the `WHERE` clause to filter the results based on the provided encounter ID.
* Since we only need the description, we only select the `description` column.

Note that I assume the `encounters` table has an `id` column that matches the provided encounter ID, and a `description` column that contains the desired information. If the table structure is different, the query may need to be adjusted accordingly.",5.115655899047852

[SQL]: SELECT ct.amount FROM claims_transactions ct WHERE ct.id='3b9ea34c-bcb3-63cd-dfdb-8947ae41c33d';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the amount of the claims transferred with a specific claim transaction ID.
* Since we're looking for the amount, we only need to query the `amount` column.
* The claim transaction ID is provided, so we can use it in the `WHERE` clause to filter the results.
* We don't need to join any other tables, as the `amount` column is likely present in the `claims_transactions` table.

Note that if the `amount` column is not present in the `claims_transactions` table, or if the claim transaction ID is not unique, the query might need to be adjusted accordingly.",4.121393918991089

[SQL]: SELECT s.quality FROM supplies s WHERE s.code='470618009';

Here's my reasoning:

* The question asks about the quality of a specific supply with the code 470618009.
* Since the question only mentions the supply code, I assume there is a table called ""supplies"" with a column ""code"" that matches the given code.
* The question asks for the quality of the supply, so I select the ""quality"" column from the ""supplies"" table.
* I use a simple WHERE clause to filter the results to only include the supply with the code 470618009.

Note that this query assumes a single table ""supplies"" with columns ""code"" and ""quality"". If the actual database schema is different, the query may need to be adjusted accordingly.",4.98136568069458

Who has been treated with the procedure Physical examination procedure (procedure)?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the given question.

[Q]: 'Who has been treated with the procedure Physical examination procedure (procedure)?'

To answer this question, we need to join the `procedures` table with the `patients` table through the `claims` table, as a claim is associated with a patient and a procedure.

Assuming the table structures are as follows:

- `procedures` table: `id`, `name` (e.g., 'Physical examination procedure')
- `claims` table: `id`, `patientid`, `procedureid` (foreign keys to `patients` and `procedures` tables)
- `patients` table: `id`, `first`, `last`

Here's the SQL query:

```
SELECT DISTINCT p.first, p.last 
FROM procedures pr 
JOIN claims cl ON pr.id = cl.procedureid 
JOIN patients p ON cl.patientid = p.id 
WHERE pr.name = 'Physical examination procedure';
```

This query joins the `procedures` table with the `claims` table on the `procedureid` foreign key, and then joins the `claims` table with the `patients` table on the `patientid` foreign key. It then selects the distinct first and last names of patients who have undergone the 'Physical examination procedure'.",5.275906085968018
What is the date of the record for the allergy described as Animal dander (substance)?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'What is the date of the record for the allergy described as Animal dander (substance)?'

To answer this question, I'll assume there are two tables: `allergies` and `records`. The `allergies` table has columns `id`, `description`, and `substance`, while the `records` table has columns `id`, `allergyid`, and `record_date`.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT r.record_date FROM allergies a JOIN records r ON a.id = r.allergyid WHERE a.description = 'Animal dander' AND a.substance = 'substance';

This query joins the `allergies` and `records` tables on the `allergyid` foreign key, filters the results to only include the allergy with the description 'Animal dander' and substance 'substance', and returns the `record_date` column.",6.080890417098999

Here's a brief explanation of the query:

* We're selecting the `date` column from the `immunizations` table, which is relevant to the question.
* We're joining the `immunizations` table with the `codes` table using the `codeid` foreign key.
* We're filtering the results to only include rows where the `code` column in the `codes` table matches the value '208'.
* We're using `DISTINCT` to remove any duplicate dates, in case there are multiple immunizations with the same date and code.",5.045861482620239
Can you tell me when the observation with the code QOLS was recorded?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT o.observation_date FROM observations o WHERE o.code='QOLS';

Here's my reasoning:

* The question asks for the observation date, so I'm selecting only the `observation_date` column from the `observations` table.
* The question specifies the code 'QOLS', so I'm using a `WHERE` clause to filter the results to only include observations with this code.
* Since the question doesn't mention any other tables, I'm not using a `JOIN`.
* I'm using `DISTINCT` to ensure that I get unique observation dates, in case there are multiple observations with the same code and date.

FROM allergies a 
JOIN patients p ON a.patientid = p.id 
JOIN allergy_codes ac ON a.allergycodeid = ac.id 
WHERE ac.code = '102263004';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks when the allergy with the code 102263004 stopped, so we need to query the `allergies` table.
* We join the `allergies` table with the `patients` table using the `patientid` foreign key.
* We also join the `allergies` table with the `allergy_codes` table using the `allergycodeid` foreign key to filter the specific allergy code.
* We use the `MAX` aggregation function to get the latest stop date for the allergy with the code 102263004.
* We filter the results using the `WHERE` clause to only consider the allergy with the code 102263004.

Note: Assuming the `stop` column exists in the `allergies` table and represents the date when the allergy stopped. If the column name is different, please adjust the query accordingly.",3.18270206451416

* The question asks for the gender of a specific patient, so we only need to query the `patients` table.
* We use the `WHERE` clause to filter the results based on the patient's first and last names, which are 'Kermit56' and 'Rutherford999', respectively.
* Since we only need the gender of the patient, we only select the `gender` column from the `patients` table.

Note that this query assumes that the `first` and `last` columns in the `patients` table contain the patient's first and last names, respectively, and that the `gender` column contains the patient's gender. If the column names or table structure are different, the query would need to be adjusted accordingly.",7.188625812530518

[Q]: 'What is the address of the patient named Shon148 Ondricka197?'

To answer this question, we need to query the patients table to find the patient with the name 'Shon148 Ondricka197' and then retrieve their address. Assuming the patients table has columns for first name, last name, and address, and the address is stored in a separate table called addresses, we can use a JOIN to combine the two tables.

[SQL]: 
SELECT a.street, a.city, a.state, a.zip

Here's the explanation:

* We need to retrieve the department id, so we select `d.id` from the `departments` table.
* The question mentions the claim ID, so we need to join the `claims` table with the `departments` table using the foreign key `departmentid`.
* We use a LEFT JOIN to ensure we get the department id even if there's no matching department.
* We filter the results using the WHERE clause to only include the claim with the specified ID.

Note: Assuming the `departmentid` column in the `claims` table is a foreign key referencing the `id` column in the `departments` table. If the foreign key relationship is different, the JOIN condition would need to be adjusted accordingly.",4.209234952926636

[Q]: 'Please provide me the encounters that were related to the allergy Shellfish (substance).'

To answer this question, I'll assume there are three tables: `encounters`, `allergies`, and `substances`. The `allergies` table has a foreign key `encounterid` referencing the `id` column in the `encounters` table, and a foreign key `substanceid` referencing the `id` column in the `substances` table.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: 
```
SELECT DISTINCT e.id, e.date, e.description 
FROM encounters e 
JOIN allergies a ON e.id = a.encounterid 
JOIN substances s ON a.substanceid = s.id 
WHERE s.name = 'Shellfish';
```

This query joins the `encounters` table with the `allergies` table on the `encounterid` foreign key, and then joins the `allergies` table with the `substances` table on the `substanceid` foreign key. It then filters the results to only include encounters related to the allergy with the substance name 'Shellfish'.

[Q]: 'What encounter is associated with the supply with the code 337388004?'

To answer this question, we need to join the `supplies` table with the `encounters` table. Assuming there is a foreign key `encounter_id` in the `supplies` table that references the `id` column in the `encounters` table, we can write the following query:

[SQL]: 
SELECT e.id, e.date 
FROM supplies s 
JOIN encounters e ON s.encounter_id = e.id 
WHERE s.code = '337388004';

This query joins the `supplies` table with the `encounters` table on the `encounter_id` column, and then filters the results to only include the supply with the code '337388004'. The `SELECT` statement only retrieves the `id` and `date` columns from the `encounters` table, which are the relevant columns to answer the question.",4.527596950531006

[SQL]: SELECT m.base_cost FROM medications m WHERE m.code='860975';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the base cost of the medication with the code 860975.
* Since the question only mentions the medication code, we can assume that the base cost is a column in the medications table.
* We use a simple SELECT statement to retrieve the base_cost column from the medications table where the code matches the given value.

Note: If the base cost is not a column in the medications table, or if there's a need to join with another table, the query would be different. However, based on the provided information, this query should answer the question.",5.012507677078247

[Q]: 'Please provide me the cost of the medication with the code 1860491.'
[SQL]: SELECT m.cost FROM medications m WHERE m.code = 1860491;

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the cost of the medication with a specific code, so we only need to query the `medications` table.
* We use the `WHERE` clause to filter the results based on the medication code.
* Since we only need the cost of the medication, we only select the `cost` column.

Note: If the medication code is not found in the database, this query will return an empty result set. If you want to handle this scenario differently, please let me know!",5.28981614112854
Who has been treated with the care plan with the code 773513001?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'Who has been treated with the care plan with the code 773513001?'

To answer this question, we need to join the `patients`, `encounters`, and `care_plans` tables. We'll assume the following table structure:

* `patients` table: `id`, `first`, `last`
* `encounters` table: `id`, `patientid`, `careplanid`
* `care_plans` table: `id`, `code`

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: 
```
SELECT DISTINCT p.first, p.last 
FROM care_plans cp 
JOIN encounters e ON cp.id = e.careplanid 
JOIN patients p ON e.patientid = p.id 
WHERE cp.code = '773513001';
```

This query joins the `care_plans` table with the `encounters` table on the `careplanid` foreign key, and then joins the `encounters` table with the `patients` table on the `patientid` foreign key. The `WHERE` clause filters the results to only include care plans with the code `773513001`. The `SELECT DISTINCT` statement ensures we get unique patient names.",5.225405693054199

[Q]: 'Where was the patient with the ID 51c2d782-1f36-657d-5618-42df22e39681 born?'

To answer this question, we need to join the `patients` table with the `demographics` table, assuming that the `demographics` table contains the birthplace information.

[SQL]: SELECT d.birthplace FROM patients p LEFT JOIN demographics d ON p.id = d.patientid WHERE p.id='51c2d782-1f36-657d-5618-42df22e39681';

This query joins the `patients` table with the `demographics` table on the `patientid` foreign key, and then filters the result to only include the patient with the specified ID. The `SELECT` statement only retrieves the `birthplace` column, which is the relevant information needed to answer the question.",6.083923578262329

FROM procedures pr 
JOIN encounters en ON pr.id = en.procedureid 
JOIN patients p ON en.patientid = p.id 
WHERE pr.name = 'Assessment of health and social care needs';

Explanation:

* We need to join three tables: procedures, encounters, and patients.
* The procedures table is joined with the encounters table on the procedureid foreign key.
* The encounters table is joined with the patients table on the patientid foreign key.
* We filter the results to only include patients treated with the specific procedure 'Assessment of health and social care needs'.

What is the address of the provider named Dale454 Wilderman619?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[SQL]: SELECT p.address FROM providers p WHERE p.first='Dale454' AND p.last='Wilderman619';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the address of a specific provider, so we only need to query the `providers` table.
* We use the `WHERE` clause to filter the results based on the provider's first and last names, which are 'Dale454' and 'Wilderman619', respectively.
* Since we only need the address, we select only the `address` column from the `providers` table.

Note that if the provider's address is not stored in the `providers` table, but rather in a separate table (e.g., `provider_addresses`), we would need to use a `JOIN` to retrieve the address. However, based on the provided information, it seems that the address is stored in the `providers` table.",4.053009748458862

JOIN conditions c ON e.id = c.encounterid 
JOIN codings cd ON c.id = cd.conditionid 
JOIN codes co ON cd.codeid = co.id 
WHERE co.name = 'Acute bronchitis (disorder)';

Explanation:

* We need to join multiple tables to get the desired result: encounters, conditions, codings, and codes.
* We use the foreign keys to join the tables: encounterid in conditions, conditionid in codings, and codeid in codes.
* We filter the results to only include encounters related to the condition 'Acute bronchitis (disorder)' by using the WHERE clause.
* We use SELECT DISTINCT to remove duplicates and only retrieve unique encounters.
* We use e.* to retrieve all columns from the encounters table, as the question doesn't specify which columns are needed.",5.262610912322998

Here's the explanation:

* We need to find the patient associated with the claim transaction, so we start with the `claim_transactions` table.
* We join the `claims` table on the `claimid` foreign key to link the claim transaction to its corresponding claim.
* Then, we join the `patients` table on the `patientid` foreign key to link the claim to its corresponding patient.
* We filter the results using the `WHERE` clause to only include the claim transaction with the specified ID.
* Finally, we use `SELECT DISTINCT` to retrieve the patient's first and last names, and `LEFT JOIN` to ensure we include all relevant data.",5.214397668838501

JOIN encounters e ON cl.encounterid = e.id 
WHERE e.id = '7b98751a-3063-b868-4d00-d4e70a888efc';

Here's the explanation:

* We need to find the total claim cost for a specific encounter, so we'll use the `claims` table and join it with the `encounters` table using the `encounterid` foreign key.
* We'll use the `SUM` aggregation function to calculate the total claim cost.
* We'll filter the results using the `WHERE` clause to only consider claims related to the specified encounter ID.
* Since we're only interested in the total claim cost, we'll select only the `cost` column from the `claims` table and use the `SUM` function to calculate the total.",7.162595748901367

JOIN substances s ON a.substance_id = s.id 
WHERE s.name = 'Tree nut';

Here's a brief explanation of the query:

* We're selecting the `recorded_date` column from the `allergies` table, which is the relevant column based on the question.
* We're joining the `allergies` table with the `substances` table on the `substance_id` foreign key, as the question mentions a specific substance (""Tree nut"").
* We're using the `WHERE` clause to filter the results to only include the ""Tree nut"" substance.
* We're using `DISTINCT` to remove any duplicate dates, in case there are multiple records of the same allergy on the same date.

Note that this query assumes the existence of an `allergies` table with a `recorded_date` column, a `substances` table with a `name` column, and a foreign key relationship between the two tables on the `substance_id` column. If the actual table structure is different, the query may need to be adjusted accordingly.",5.4101550579071045
For which patient did the medication with the code 308136 is prescribed for?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'For which patient did the medication with the code 308136 is prescribed for?'

To answer this question, we need to join the `medications` table with the `prescriptions` table and then with the `patients` table. We'll use the foreign keys to establish the relationships between the tables.

[SQL]: 
```
SELECT DISTINCT p.first, p.last 
FROM medications m 
JOIN prescriptions pr ON m.id = pr.medicationid 
JOIN patients p ON pr.patientid = p.id 
WHERE m.code = '308136';

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT p.first, p.last 
FROM organizations o 
JOIN patients p ON o.id = p.organizationid 
WHERE o.name = 'LIFE CARE CENTER OF WEST BRIDGEWATER';

Here's a brief explanation of the query:

* We start by selecting the `first` and `last` columns from the `patients` table, as we want to retrieve the names of the patients.
* We join the `organizations` table with the `patients` table on the `organizationid` foreign key, which links a patient to an organization.
* We filter the results to only include patients linked to the organization with the name 'LIFE CARE CENTER OF WEST BRIDGEWATER' using the `WHERE` clause.

Note that I assume the existence of the following tables and columns:

* `organizations` table with columns `id` and `name`
* `patients` table with columns `id`, `first`, `last`, and `organizationid` (foreign key referencing the `id` column in the `organizations` table)",5.871207237243652

WHERE s.uid = '1.2.840.99999999.1.69579675.1177080368676';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the body site code related to the imaging study with a specific series UID.
* We need to join the `imaging_studies` table with the `series` table using the foreign key `imaging_study_id`.
* We filter the results using the `WHERE` clause to only include the series with the specified UID.
* We use `SELECT DISTINCT` to retrieve unique body site codes.
* We only query the `body_site_code` column, as it's the only relevant column mentioned in the question.",5.484264612197876

[Q]: 'Please provide me the modality description of the imaging study with the ID 781242f7-dd9c-8a26-181a-65898eb64eb4.'

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT i.modality_description FROM imaging_studies i WHERE i.id='781242f7-dd9c-8a26-181a-65898eb64eb4';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the modality description of the imaging study with a specific ID.
* Since the question only mentions the imaging study, we only need to query the `imaging_studies` table.
* We use the `WHERE` clause to filter the results based on the provided ID.
* We use `SELECT DISTINCT` to ensure we get a unique result, as the question asks for a specific modality description.

Note: Assuming the `imaging_studies` table has a column named `modality_description` and an `id` column that matches the provided ID. If the column names are different, please adjust the query accordingly.",5.149120330810547
Please provide me the encounters that were related to the procedure with code 430193006.,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the given question.

Here's the answer:

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT e.* FROM procedures p 
JOIN encounters e ON p.encounterid = e.id 
WHERE p.code = '430193006';

Explanation:

* We need to query the `procedures` table to filter by the procedure code '430193006'.
* Since we want to retrieve the related encounters, we need to join the `procedures` table with the `encounters` table using the `encounterid` foreign key.
* We use `SELECT DISTINCT` to retrieve unique encounters.
* We use `e.*` to select all columns from the `encounters` table, as the question doesn't specify which columns are required.

Here's the explanation:

* We need to query the `imaging_studies` table to find the patient ID associated with the imaging study with the given ID.
* We use a LEFT JOIN to connect the `imaging_studies` table with the `patients` table on the `patientid` foreign key.
* We select only the `id` column from the `patients` table, as it's the only relevant column for this question.
* We use the `DISTINCT` keyword to ensure we get unique patient IDs.
* We filter the results using the `WHERE` clause to only include the imaging study with the specified ID.",5.221254825592041
Please provide me the provider associated with the claim transaction dc749622-be92-6080-e170-7f55b642be3a.,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'Please provide me the provider associated with the claim transaction dc749622-be92-6080-e170-7f55b642be3a.'

To answer this question, I'll assume there are three tables: `claims`, `providers`, and `claim_transactions`. The `claim_transactions` table has a foreign key `claim_id` referencing the `id` column in the `claims` table, and the `claims` table has a foreign key `provider_id` referencing the `id` column in the `providers` table.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: 
SELECT DISTINCT pr.first, pr.last 
FROM claim_transactions ct 
JOIN claims cl ON ct.claim_id = cl.id 
JOIN providers pr ON cl.provider_id = pr.id 
WHERE ct.id = 'dc749622-be92-6080-e170-7f55b642be3a';

This query joins the `claim_transactions` table with the `claims` table on the `claim_id` column, and then joins the resulting table with the `providers` table on the `provider_id` column. It then selects the distinct `first` and `last` names of the provider associated with the claim transaction having the specified ID.",6.387313604354858
What city is the organization ARBOUR-FULLER HOSPITAL located in?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT o.city FROM organizations o WHERE o.name='ARBOUR-FULLER HOSPITAL';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the city of the organization 'ARBOUR-FULLER HOSPITAL', so we only need to query the 'city' column.
* Since the question mentions a specific organization, we can directly query the 'organizations' table.
* We use the 'WHERE' clause to filter the results for the organization with the name 'ARBOUR-FULLER HOSPITAL'.
* We use 'DISTINCT' to ensure we get a unique result, in case there are multiple entries for the same organization (although unlikely in this case).

Note: If the 'organizations' table has a separate 'address' table, and the 'city' column is in the 'address' table, we would need to use a JOIN to connect the two tables. However, based on the provided information, it seems that the 'city' column is in the 'organizations' table itself.",6.19823145866394
Please provide me the patient associated with the imaging study with the ID fcfb6b6f-4e61-9c7b-0055-6fd47a81e5fd.,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the given question.

[Q]: 'Please provide me the patient associated with the imaging study with the ID fcfb6b6f-4e61-9c7b-0055-6fd47a81e5fd.'

To answer this question, we need to join the `imaging_studies` table with the `patients` table through the `claims` table, as the `imaging_studies` table is likely related to the `claims` table, and the `claims` table is related to the `patients` table.

[SQL]: 
SELECT DISTINCT p.first, p.last 
FROM imaging_studies is 
JOIN claims cl ON is.claim_id = cl.id 
JOIN patients p ON cl.patientid = p.id

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT e.id, e.date, e.description 
FROM encounters e 
JOIN allergies a ON e.id = a.encounterid 
WHERE a.code = '1191';

Here's a brief explanation of the query:

* We're selecting the `id`, `date`, and `description` columns from the `encounters` table, as they are likely to be relevant to the question.
* We're joining the `encounters` table with the `allergies` table on the `encounterid` foreign key, as it's the common column between the two tables.
* We're filtering the results to only include rows where the `code` column in the `allergies` table matches the value '1191'.

Note that I'm assuming the existence of the `encounterid` foreign key in the `allergies` table, which links an allergy to a specific encounter. If this assumption is incorrect, please provide more information about the database schema.",5.430646181106567
Please provide me reasons for performing the procedure Movement therapy (regime/therapy).,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

Explanation:

* The question asks for the reasons for performing the procedure ""Movement therapy"".
* We need to join the `procedures` table with the `procedure_reasons` table using the foreign key `procedureid`.
* We filter the results to only include the procedure with the name ""Movement therapy"".
* We select the distinct `reason` column from the `procedure_reasons` table.

Note: I assume that the `procedures` table has a column `name` that stores the procedure names, and the `procedure_reasons` table has a column `reason` that stores the reasons for each procedure. If the column names are different, please let me know and I'll adjust the query accordingly.",6.616068124771118

[SQL]: SELECT e.reason_description FROM encounters e WHERE e.id='0eb92416-16a9-f734-e8aa-03d87c5240dd';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the reason description for a specific encounter ID, so we only need to query the `encounters` table.
* We use the `WHERE` clause to filter the results for the specific encounter ID mentioned in the question.
* Since we only need the reason description, we only select that column in the `SELECT` statement.

Note: If the `encounters` table has a different column name for the reason description, please replace `reason_description` with the actual column name.",4.178673982620239

When was the care plan Diabetes self management plan used?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'When was the care plan Diabetes self management plan used?'

To answer this question, I'll assume there are two tables: `care_plans` and `care_plan_usages`. The `care_plans` table has columns `id`, `name`, and the `care_plan_usages` table has columns `id`, `care_plan_id`, and `used_at`.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT cpu.used_at FROM care_plans cp INNER JOIN care_plan_usages cpu ON cp.id = cpu.care_plan_id WHERE cp.name = 'Diabetes self management plan';

This query joins the `care_plans` table with the `care_plan_usages` table on the `care_plan_id` foreign key. It then selects the `used_at` column from the `care_plan_usages` table where the `name` column in the `care_plans` table is 'Diabetes self management plan'. The `DISTINCT` keyword is used to remove duplicate `used_at` values.",3.2974116802215576
Please provide me reasons for performing the procedure Medication Reconciliation (procedure).,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

Here's a brief explanation of the query:

* We need to count the number of distinct medications, so we use `COUNT(DISTINCT m.id)`.
* We join the `medications` table with the `claims` table on the `claimid` foreign key.
* We then join the `claims` table with the `payers` table on the `payerid` foreign key.
* We filter the results to only include claims with the payer name 'NO_INSURANCE'.

Note: Assuming the table and column names are correct, if the schema is different, the query might need to be adjusted accordingly.",5.455127239227295
What is the most promising procedure for a patient with Allergy to substance (finding)?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

Here's the question: ""What is the most promising procedure for a patient with Allergy to substance (finding)?""

To answer this question, I'll assume the following tables and columns:

* `patients` table with columns `id`, `first`, `last`
* `findings` table with columns `id`, `patientid`, `description` (e.g., ""Allergy to substance"")
* `procedures` table with columns `id`, `findingid`, `description`, `promise` (e.g., a rating or score indicating the promise of the procedure)

Here's the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT p.first, p.last, pr.description AS procedure, pr.promise
FROM findings f
JOIN patients p ON f.patientid = p.id
JOIN procedures pr ON f.id = pr.findingid
WHERE f.description = 'Allergy to substance'
ORDER BY pr.promise DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

This query:

1. Joins the `findings` table with the `patients` table on the `patientid` foreign key.
2. Joins the resulting table with the `procedures` table on the `findingid` foreign key.
3. Filters the results to only include findings with the description ""Allergy to substance"".
4. Orders the results by the `promise` column in descending order (highest promise first).
5. Limits the result to the top 1 row, which represents the most promising procedure.

Note that this query assumes the existence of the `promise` column in the `procedures` table, which may not be the case in the actual database schema. If the promise of a procedure is not stored in the database, the query would need to be modified accordingly.",5.559273958206177

JOIN encounters e ON cl.encounterid = e.id 
WHERE e.id = 'eeb3c5ce-d328-49a1-1abb-9396da4163fd';

Here's the explanation:

* We need to find the total claim cost for a specific encounter, so we'll use the `SUM` aggregation function.
* We'll query the `claims` table, which likely contains the claim costs.
* Since we need to filter by a specific encounter, we'll join the `claims` table with the `encounters` table using the `encounterid` foreign key.
* We'll use the `WHERE` clause to filter the results for the specific encounter ID `eeb3c5ce-d328-49a1-1abb-9396da4163fd`.

FROM medications m 
JOIN coverage c ON m.id = c.medicationid 
JOIN payers p ON c.payerid = p.id 
WHERE p.name = 'Medicaid';

Here's a brief explanation of the query:

* We need to count the number of medications covered by the payer Medicaid, so we use the `COUNT(DISTINCT m.id)` aggregation function.
* We join the `medications` table with the `coverage` table on the `medicationid` foreign key.
* We then join the `coverage` table with the `payers` table on the `payerid` foreign key.
* Finally, we filter the results to only include rows where the payer name is 'Medicaid'.

Note that this query assumes the existence of the following tables and columns:

* `medications` table with an `id` column

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the recorded date of the allergy with the code 3718001.
* We need to query the `allergies` table, which likely has a column for the recorded date and the allergy code.
* Since the question doesn't mention a specific patient, we don't need to join with the `patients` table. However, I've included the join in case the `allergies` table has a foreign key referencing the `patients` table.
* We use the `WHERE` clause to filter the results to only include the allergy with the code 3718001.
* We only select the `recorded_date` column, as it's the only relevant information needed to answer the question.",7.907805919647217
Please provide me the encounters that are related to the care plan Surgical inpatient care plan (record artifact).,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'Please provide me the encounters that are related to the care plan Surgical inpatient care plan (record artifact).'

To answer this question, I'll assume the following tables and columns:

* `care_plans` table with columns `id`, `name`
* `encounters` table with columns `id`, `care_plan_id` (foreign key referencing `care_plans.id`)
* `record_artifacts` table with columns `id`, `care_plan_id` (foreign key referencing `care_plans.id`)

FROM supplies s 
JOIN physical_objects po ON s.physical_object_id = po.id 
WHERE po.name = 'Disposable air-purifying respirator';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks when the supply ""Disposable air-purifying respirator"" was recorded, so we need to query the `recorded_at` column.
* The supply is a physical object, so we need to join the `supplies` table with the `physical_objects` table using the foreign key `physical_object_id`.
* We filter the results to only include the specific physical object ""Disposable air-purifying respirator"" using the `WHERE` clause.
* Since we only need the `recorded_at` column, we use `SELECT DISTINCT` to remove duplicates and only retrieve the relevant column.",5.007030963897705

JOIN claims c ON i.claimid = c.id 
JOIN payers p ON c.payerid = p.id 
WHERE p.name = 'Medicaid' AND c.covered = FALSE;
```

Explanation:

* We need to count the number of immunizations that are not covered by the payer Medicaid.
* We join the `immunizations` table with the `claims` table on the `claimid` column, and then join the `claims` table with the `payers` table on the `payerid` column.
* We filter the results to only include immunizations where the payer is Medicaid and the claim is not covered (`c.covered = FALSE`).
* We use `COUNT(DISTINCT i.id)` to count the number of unique immunizations that meet the conditions.

Note: This query assumes that the `payers` table has a `name` column, the `claims` table has a `payerid` and `covered` columns, and the `immunizations` table has a `claimid` column. If the column names are different, the query will need to be adjusted accordingly.",6.670051097869873

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT bs.code FROM imaging_studies is LEFT JOIN body_sites bs ON is.body_site_id = bs.id WHERE is.id='7704ac27-36c1-d24f-32b7-eb856ad3cc10';

This query joins the `imaging_studies` table with the `body_sites` table on the `body_site_id` foreign key, and then selects the `code` column from the `body_sites` table where the `id` column in `imaging_studies` matches the given ID.",5.142971515655518
What is the successrate of medication NDA020800 0.3 ML Epinephrine 1 MG/ML Auto-Injector?,"Based on the provided question, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query. Here's the answer:

[SQL]: 
SELECT 
    COUNT(CASE WHEN outcomes.outcome = 'Success' THEN 1 ELSE NULL END) / COUNT(outcomes.outcome) AS success_rate
FROM 
    medications m 
JOIN 
    outcomes ON m.id = outcomes.medicationid 
WHERE 
    m.name = 'NDA020800 0.3 ML Epinephrine 1 MG/ML Auto-Injector';

Here's the explanation:

* We need to find the success rate of a specific medication, so we'll focus on the `medications` and `outcomes` tables.
* We'll use a `JOIN` to link the `medications` table with the `outcomes` table based on the foreign key `medicationid`.
* We'll filter the results to only include the specific medication mentioned in the question using the `WHERE` clause.
* To calculate the success rate, we'll use a `CASE` statement to count the number of successful outcomes and divide it by the total number of outcomes for that medication.

Note: This assumes that the `outcomes` table has a column named `outcome` with values like 'Success' or 'Failure', and that the `medications` table has a column named `name` with the medication names. If the column names are different, the query will need to be adjusted accordingly.",6.313528060913086

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT p.name FROM medications m 
JOIN claims cl ON m.id = cl.medicationid 
JOIN payers p ON cl.payerid = p.id 
WHERE m.name = 'Digoxin 0.125 MG Oral Tablet';

Explanation:

* We need to find the payer who paid for the medication 'Digoxin 0.125 MG Oral Tablet'.
* We start by selecting the distinct payer names from the `payers` table.
* We join the `medications` table with the `claims` table on the `medicationid` foreign key, as a claim is related to a medication.
* We then join the `claims` table with the `payers` table on the `payerid` foreign key, as a claim is related to a payer.
* Finally, we filter the results to only include the medication 'Digoxin 0.125 MG Oral Tablet' using the `WHERE` clause.",6.537971019744873

FROM prescriptions pr 
JOIN medications m ON pr.medicationid = m.id 
JOIN patients p ON pr.patientid = p.id 
WHERE m.code = '197604';

Explanation:

* We need to join three tables: prescriptions, medications, and patients.
* The medications table is joined with the prescriptions table on the medicationid foreign key.
* The patients table is joined with the prescriptions table on the patientid foreign key.
* We filter the results to only include patients prescribed the medication with the code '197604'.

What is the most promising procedure for a patient with Allergy to substance (finding)?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

Here's the query:

```
SELECT DISTINCT p.procedure 
FROM findings f 
JOIN patients p ON f.patientid = p.id 
JOIN procedures pr ON f.procedureid = pr.id 
WHERE f.finding = 'Allergy to substance' 
ORDER BY pr.efficacy DESC 
LIMIT 1;
```

Here's the explanation:

* We need to find the most promising procedure for a patient with a specific finding, which is 'Allergy to substance'.
* We join three tables: `findings`, `patients`, and `procedures`.
* We use the `findings` table to filter the results based on the specific finding.
* We use the `patients` table to link the finding to the patient.
* We use the `procedures` table to get the procedure details and efficacy.
* We use the `ORDER BY` clause to sort the results by efficacy in descending order (highest efficacy first).
* We use the `LIMIT 1` clause to get the top-most promising procedure.

Note: I assume that the `procedures` table has an `efficacy` column that represents the effectiveness of each procedure. If this column doesn't exist, the query would need to be modified accordingly.",6.337219953536987
Please provide me the modality description of the imaging study with the ID 3754ef74-401a-b32a-a498-a47b329bbbd2.,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'Please provide me the modality description of the imaging study with the ID 3754ef74-401a-b32a-a498-a47b329bbbd2.'

To answer this question, I'll assume there are two tables: `imaging_studies` and `modalities`. The `imaging_studies` table has a foreign key `modality_id` that references the `id` column in the `modalities` table.

[SQL]: SELECT m.description FROM imaging_studies is LEFT JOIN modalities m ON is.modality_id = m.id WHERE is.id='3754ef74-401a-b32a-a498-a47b329bbbd2';

This query joins the `imaging_studies` table with the `modalities` table on the `modality_id` foreign key, and then filters the results to only include the row with the specified `id` in the `imaging_studies` table. The `SELECT` statement only retrieves the `description` column from the `modalities` table, which is the requested information.",5.627986669540405
How many encounters are uncovered by the payer Anthem?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'How many encounters are uncovered by the payer Anthem?'

To answer this question, I'll assume there are three tables: `encounters`, `claims`, and `payers`. The `claims` table has a foreign key `payerid` referencing the `id` column in the `payers` table, and the `encounters` table has a foreign key `claimid` referencing the `id` column in the `claims` table.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT e.id) 
FROM encounters e 
JOIN claims cl ON e.claimid = cl.id 
JOIN payers p ON cl.payerid = p.id 
WHERE p.name = 'Anthem' AND cl.covered = FALSE;

This query joins the `encounters`, `claims`, and `payers` tables using their respective foreign keys. It then filters the results to only include encounters where the payer is 'Anthem' and the claim is not covered (i.e., uncovered). Finally, it counts the distinct encounter IDs to provide the answer to the question.",6.4048027992248535
Please provide me the encounters that are related to the observation with the code 93030-5.,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the given question.

Here's the answer:

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT e.* 
FROM observations o 
JOIN encounters e ON o.encounterid = e.id 
WHERE o.code = '93030-5';

Explanation:

* We need to query the `observations` table to find the observation with the code '93030-5'.
* Since we want to retrieve the related encounters, we need to join the `observations` table with the `encounters` table using the `encounterid` foreign key.
* We use `SELECT DISTINCT` to retrieve unique encounters.
* We use `e.*` to select all columns from the `encounters` table.
* The `WHERE` clause filters the results to only include observations with the code '93030-5'.",5.264166593551636
Could you provide information about the ethnicity of the patient named Andrea7 Kunde533?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'Could you provide information about the ethnicity of the patient named Andrea7 Kunde533?'

To answer this question, we need to join the `patients` table with the `demographics` table, assuming that the `demographics` table contains the ethnicity information and is linked to the `patients` table through a foreign key.

[SQL]: 
SELECT d.ethnicity 
FROM patients p 
JOIN demographics d ON p.id = d.patientid 
WHERE p.first = 'Andrea7' AND p.last = 'Kunde533';",4.8495495319366455
What is the health care coverage status of the patient named Larraine124 Dare640?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT p.first, p.last, hc.status 
FROM patients p 
LEFT JOIN healthcare_coverage hc ON p.id = hc.patientid 
WHERE p.first='Larraine124' AND p.last='Dare640';

Here's a brief explanation of the query:

* We're selecting the `first` and `last` names of the patient, as well as the `status` of their healthcare coverage.
* We're joining the `patients` table with the `healthcare_coverage` table on the `patientid` foreign key.
* We're filtering the results to only include the patient with the name 'Larraine124 Dare640' using the `WHERE` clause.
* We're using `DISTINCT` to ensure we only get one result per patient, even if they have multiple healthcare coverage records.

Note that this query assumes the existence of a `healthcare_coverage` table with a `patientid` foreign key referencing the `id` column in the `patients` table, and a `status` column containing the healthcare coverage status. If this is not the case, the query may need to be adjusted accordingly.",5.42108678817749

JOIN procedure_codes pc ON pr.id = pc.procedureid 
JOIN codes c ON pc.codeid = c.id 
WHERE c.code='454711000124102';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the reason for performing the procedure with a specific code, so we need to join the `procedures` table with the `procedure_codes` table and then with the `codes` table.
* We use the foreign keys to join the tables: `pr.id` with `pc.procedureid` and `pc.codeid` with `c.id`.
* We filter the results to only include the procedure with the code `454711000124102`.
* We select the `description` column from the `procedures` table, which should contain the reason for performing the procedure.",5.010855674743652

Please provide me the encounters that were related to the allergy Tree pollen (substance).,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'Please provide me the encounters that were related to the allergy Tree pollen (substance).'

To answer this question, I'll assume there are three tables: `encounters`, `allergies`, and `substances`. The `allergies` table has a foreign key `encounterid` referencing the `id` column in the `encounters` table, and a foreign key `substanceid` referencing the `id` column in the `substances` table.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]:

SELECT DISTINCT e.id, e.date, e.description 
FROM encounters e 
JOIN allergies a ON e.id = a.encounterid 
JOIN substances s ON a.substanceid = s.id 
WHERE s.name = 'Tree pollen';
```

This query joins the `encounters` table with the `allergies` table on the `encounterid` foreign key, and then joins the `allergies` table with the `substances` table on the `substanceid` foreign key. It then filters the results to only include encounters related to the allergy with the substance name 'Tree pollen'. The `DISTINCT` keyword is used to remove duplicate encounter records.",4.223430395126343

This query joins the `encounters` table with the `device_encounters` table on the `encounter_id` column, and then joins the result with the `devices` table on the `device_id` column. The `WHERE` clause filters the results to only include encounters related to the device with the name 'Home nebulizer'. The `SELECT DISTINCT` statement ensures that only unique encounters are returned.",5.7081685066223145
Please provide me the cost of the medication lisinopril 10 MG Oral Tablet.,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

Here's the answer:

[SQL]: SELECT cost FROM medications m JOIN medication_costs mc ON m.id = mc.medicationid WHERE m.name='lisinopril 10 MG Oral Tablet';

Explanation:

* We need to query the cost of the medication 'lisinopril 10 MG Oral Tablet', so we'll select the 'cost' column.
* The medication name is mentioned in the question, so we'll use the 'name' column in the 'medications' table.
* The cost of the medication is likely stored in a separate table, 'medication_costs', which is related to the 'medications' table through a foreign key. We'll use a JOIN to combine these two tables.
* We'll use the 'WHERE' clause to filter the results to only include the medication with the specified name.

Note: This query assumes that the 'medications' table has an 'id' column that is referenced by the 'medicationid' foreign key in the 'medication_costs' table. If the actual table structure is different, the query may need to be adjusted accordingly.",6.206318378448486

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT d.udi FROM devices d LEFT JOIN device_identifiers di ON d.id = di.deviceid WHERE di.identifier='702172008';

Here's a brief explanation of the query:

* We're selecting the `udi` column from the `devices` table, which is the relevant column based on the question.
* We're joining the `devices` table with the `device_identifiers` table using the `deviceid` foreign key.
* We're filtering the results to only include rows where the `identifier` column in the `device_identifiers` table matches the given code '702172008'.
* We're using `DISTINCT` to remove any duplicate `udi` codes, if any.

Note that the exact table and column names might vary depending on the actual database schema. This query is based on the assumption that the `devices` table has a column named `udi`, and the `device_identifiers` table has columns named `deviceid` and `identifier`.",6.112973213195801
What encounter is associated with the observation with the code 93026-3?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'What encounter is associated with the observation with the code 93026-3?'

To answer this question, we need to join the `observations` table with the `encounters` table. Assuming there is a foreign key `encounterid` in the `observations` table that references the `id` column in the `encounters` table, we can write the following query:

[SQL]: 
SELECT e.id, e.date 
FROM observations o 
JOIN encounters e ON o.encounterid = e.id 
WHERE o.code = '93026-3';

This query joins the `observations` table with the `encounters` table on the `encounterid` column, and then filters the results to only include the encounter associated with the observation having the code '93026-3'. The `SELECT` statement only retrieves the `id` and `date` columns from the `encounters` table, which are the relevant columns to answer the question.",6.165601015090942

What is the base cost of medication Warfarin Sodium 5 MG Oral Tablet?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[SQL]: SELECT m.base_cost FROM medications m WHERE m.name='Warfarin Sodium 5 MG Oral Tablet';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the base cost of a specific medication, so we only need to query the `medications` table.
* We use the `WHERE` clause to filter the results to only include the medication with the name 'Warfarin Sodium 5 MG Oral Tablet'.
* We select only the `base_cost` column, as it's the only relevant column mentioned in the question.

Note: I assume that the `medications` table has a column named `name` that stores the medication names, and a column named `base_cost` that stores the base cost of each medication. If the column names are different, please let me know and I'll adjust the query accordingly.",4.078372478485107
Please provide me the number of medications covered by the payer with the ID 734afbd6-4794-363b-9bc0-6a3981533ed5.,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'Please provide me the number of medications covered by the payer with the ID 734afbd6-4794-363b-9bc0-6a3981533ed5.'

To answer this question, I'll assume there are two tables: `payers` and `medications`. The `payers` table has a column `id` with the payer's ID, and the `medications` table has a column `payerid` that references the `id` column in the `payers` table, indicating which payer covers the medication.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT m.id) FROM payers p LEFT JOIN medications m ON p.id = m.payerid WHERE p.id='734afbd6-4794-363b-9bc0-6a3981533ed5';

This query joins the `payers` table with the `medications` table on the `payerid` column, filters the results to only include the payer with the specified ID, and then counts the distinct medications covered by that payer.",6.680404424667358
Please provide me the patients receiving aid under the care plan with code 698360004.,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'Please provide me the patients receiving aid under the care plan with code 698360004.'

To answer this question, we need to join the `patients`, `care_plans`, and `care_plan_codes` tables. We'll assume the following table structures:

* `patients`: `id`, `first`, `last`
* `care_plans`: `id`, `patientid` (foreign key referencing `patients.id`)
* `care_plan_codes`: `id`, `careplanid` (foreign key referencing `care_plans.id`), `code`

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: 
```
SELECT DISTINCT p.first, p.last 
FROM care_plan_codes cpc 
JOIN care_plans cp ON cpc.careplanid = cp.id 
JOIN patients p ON cp.patientid = p.id 
WHERE cpc.code = '698360004';
```

This query joins the `care_plan_codes` table with the `care_plans` table on the `careplanid` foreign key, and then joins the `care_plans` table with the `patients` table on the `patientid` foreign key. The `WHERE` clause filters the results to only include care plans with the code `698360004`. Finally, the `SELECT` statement retrieves the distinct `first` and `last` names of the patients receiving aid under these care plans.",5.3434529304504395
What is the date of the record for the allergy with the code 84489001?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'What is the date of the record for the allergy with the code 84489001?'

To answer this question, I'll assume there are two tables: `allergies` and `records`. The `allergies` table has columns `id`, `code`, and `record_id`, and the `records` table has columns `id` and `date`.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT r.date FROM allergies a JOIN records r ON a.record_id = r.id WHERE a.code = '84489001';

This query joins the `allergies` table with the `records` table on the `record_id` foreign key, and then filters the results to only include the record with the allergy code '84489001'. The `SELECT` statement only retrieves the `date` column from the `records` table.",6.155930995941162
Please provide me the number of immunizations covered by the payer with the ID 26aab0cd-6aba-3e1b-ac5b-05c8867e762c.,"Based on the provided question, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query. Here's the answer:

[SQL]: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT i.id) 
FROM payers p 
JOIN coverage c ON p.id = c.payerid 
JOIN immunizations i ON c.id = i.coverageid 
WHERE p.id='26aab0cd-6aba-3e1b-ac5b-05c8867e762c';

Here's the explanation:

* We need to count the number of immunizations covered by the payer with the ID '26aab0cd-6aba-3e1b-ac5b-05c8867e762c'.
* We start by selecting from the `payers` table where the `id` matches the given ID.
* We then join the `coverage` table on the `payerid` foreign key.
* Next, we join the `immunizations` table on the `coverageid` foreign key.
* Finally, we use the `COUNT(DISTINCT i.id)` aggregation function to count the number of unique immunizations covered by the payer.

Note that I assumed the existence of the following tables and columns:

* `payers` table with columns `id` (primary key)
* `coverage` table with columns `id` (primary key), `payerid` (foreign key referencing `payers.id`)
* `immunizations` table with columns `id` (primary key), `coverageid` (foreign key referencing `coverage.id`)",5.83597469329834

Here's a brief explanation of the query:

* We need to find the encounter where the imaging study with the specific series UID was conducted.
* We join the `imaging_studies` table with the `encounters` table on the `encounter_id` foreign key.
* We filter the results to only include the row where the `series_uid` matches the given value.
* We only select the `encounter_id` column, as it's the only relevant information needed to answer the question.",6.004990339279175

[Q]: 'Please provide me the series UID of the imaging study with the ID 7d52afa5-9282-64ef-e08c-c66f1a53e7f2.'

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT is.studyuid FROM imagingstudies is WHERE is.id='7d52afa5-9282-64ef-e08c-c66f1a53e7f2';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the series UID of the imaging study with a specific ID.
* We can directly query the `imagingstudies` table since the ID is provided.
* We use the `DISTINCT` keyword to ensure we get unique results, although in this case, it's unlikely to have duplicate series UIDs for the same imaging study ID.
* We select only the `studyuid` column, which is the relevant column mentioned in the question.
* We filter the results using the `WHERE` clause with the provided ID.",6.125252723693848

[Q]: 'What is the birthdate of the patient named Lionel365 Bogisich202?'

To answer this question, we need to query the `patients` table, assuming it has columns for `first`, `last`, and `birthdate`. We'll use the `WHERE` clause to filter the patient with the exact name.

[SQL]: SELECT birthdate FROM patients WHERE first='Lionel365' AND last='Bogisich202';

This query will return the birthdate of the patient named Lionel365 Bogisich202.",4.294726371765137

[Q]: 'Please provide me the amount transacted with the claim transaction ID b84b66d6-3f27-15d4-d340-de5d496ae433.'

[SQL]: SELECT ct.amount FROM claim_transactions ct WHERE ct.id='b84b66d6-3f27-15d4-d340-de5d496ae433';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the amount transacted, so we only need to select the `amount` column.
* The question provides a specific `claim transaction ID`, so we can use that to filter the results in the `WHERE` clause.
* Since the question only mentions the `claim transaction ID`, we don't need to join any other tables. We can directly query the `claim_transactions` table.

Note: Assuming the `claim_transactions` table has an `id` column that matches the provided `claim transaction ID`, and an `amount` column that stores the transacted amount.",5.0372679233551025

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT o.recorded_date FROM observations o WHERE o.code='55758-7';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the recorded date of the observation with the code 55758-7.
* Since the question only mentions the observation code, we only need to query the `observations` table.
* We use the `SELECT DISTINCT` statement to retrieve unique recorded dates.
* We filter the results using the `WHERE` clause to only include observations with the code 55758-7.

Note: If the `recorded_date` column is not present in the `observations` table, the query would need to be modified accordingly.",4.776156425476074

[SQL]: SELECT p.income_status FROM patients p WHERE p.id='78f1bf7e-e457-a55f-443d-2e54291ce0e3';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the income status of a specific patient with ID '78f1bf7e-e457-a55f-443d-2e54291ce0e3'.
* Since the question only requires the income status, we only need to query the `patients` table.
* We use the `WHERE` clause to filter the result to the specific patient with the given ID.
* We don't need to use `JOIN` or `GROUP BY` in this case, as we're only querying a single table and don't need to aggregate any data.",5.266135931015015

[SQL]: SELECT i.income_status FROM patients p LEFT JOIN incomes i ON p.id = i.patient_id WHERE p.first='Voncile324' AND p.last='Zemlak964';

Here's the explanation:

* We need to find the income status of the patient named Voncile324 Zemlak964, so we'll query the `incomes` table for the `income_status` column.
* Since we have the patient's name, we'll join the `patients` table with the `incomes` table using the `patient_id` foreign key.
* We'll use the `WHERE` clause to filter the results based on the patient's first and last names.
* We don't need to use `DISTINCT` in this case, as we're looking for a specific patient's income status.",6.2323949337005615
Please provide description of the encounters that are linked with the organization LEMUEL SHATTUCK HOSPITAL.,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT e.description 
FROM encounters e 
JOIN organizations o ON e.organizationid = o.id 
WHERE o.name='LEMUEL SHATTUCK HOSPITAL';

Here's a brief explanation of the query:

* We're selecting the `description` column from the `encounters` table, as that's what the question asks for.
* We're joining the `encounters` table with the `organizations` table on the `organizationid` foreign key, which links an encounter to an organization.
* We're filtering the results to only include encounters linked to the organization with the name 'LEMUEL SHATTUCK HOSPITAL'.

Note that I'm assuming the existence of the `organizationid` foreign key in the `encounters` table, which references the `id` column in the `organizations` table. If this is not the case, please provide more information about the database schema.",4.477117300033569
Which illness is most common in warmer climates?,"To answer this question, we need to assume that there are tables for `patients`, `claims`, `illnesses`, and `locations`. We also need to assume that `locations` have a column for `climate` and `patients` have a column for `location_id` which is a foreign key referencing the `id` column in the `locations` table.

Here's a possible SQL query:

```
SELECT i.name, COUNT(DISTINCT p.id) as count
FROM patients p
JOIN locations l ON p.location_id = l.id
JOIN claims cl ON p.id = cl.patientid
JOIN illnesses i ON cl.illnessid = i.id
WHERE l.climate = 'warmer'
GROUP BY i.name
ORDER BY count DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

This query joins the `patients`, `locations`, `claims`, and `illnesses` tables to get the count of each illness in warmer climates. It then groups the results by illness name and orders them in descending order of count. The `LIMIT 1` clause is used to get the most common illness.

Please note that this query is based on the assumptions made about the table structure and column names. The actual query may vary depending on the actual database schema.",5.714069843292236
What provider is associated with the claim transaction 2e12d9b5-8d89-c575-f4d0-3797501ab90c?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'What provider is associated with the claim transaction 2e12d9b5-8d89-c575-f4d0-3797501ab90c?'

To answer this question, we need to join the `claims` table with the `providers` table, as the provider information is likely associated with the claim transaction.

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT pr.first, pr.last FROM claims cl LEFT JOIN providers pr ON cl.providerid = pr.id WHERE cl.id='2e12d9b5-8d89-c575-f4d0-3797501ab90c';

This query joins the `claims` table with the `providers` table on the `providerid` foreign key, and then filters the results to only include the claim transaction with the specified ID. The `SELECT DISTINCT` statement ensures that we only get unique provider names.",5.102412462234497

[SQL]: SELECT a.recorded_date FROM allergies a LEFT JOIN patients p ON a.patient_id = p.id WHERE a.code = '782576004';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the recorded date of the allergy with a specific code, so we only need to query the `recorded_date` column.
* The allergy code is explicitly mentioned in the question, so we use it in the `WHERE` clause.
* We assume that the `allergies` table has a foreign key `patient_id` that references the `id` column in the `patients` table, so we use a `LEFT JOIN` to link the two tables.
* Since we're only interested in the recorded date, we don't need to use `DISTINCT` or `GROUP BY` in this query.",6.009948253631592
What are the survival chances of allgery Aspirin?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

However, I need to make an assumption about the database schema and the tables involved. Let's assume we have two tables: `allergies` and `treatments`. The `allergies` table has columns `id`, `name`, and `survival_chances`, and the `treatments` table has columns `id`, `allergy_id` (foreign key referencing `allergies.id`), and `name`.

With that assumption, here's the SQL query to answer the question:

[SQL]: SELECT a.survival_chances FROM allergies a WHERE a.name='Aspirin';

This query selects the `survival_chances` column from the `allergies` table where the `name` column is 'Aspirin'.

Please note that if the database schema is different or if there are additional tables involved, the query might need to be adjusted accordingly.",7.7585883140563965

FROM encounters e 
JOIN allergies a ON e.id = a.encounterid 
JOIN substances s ON a.substanceid = s.id 
WHERE s.name = 'Animal dander';

Here's the explanation:

* We need to find the encounter related to the allergy ""Animal dander (substance)"".
* We have three tables involved: encounters, allergies, and substances.
* We use the foreign keys to join the tables: encounterid in allergies table references the id in encounters table, and substanceid in allergies table references the id in substances table.
* We filter the results to only include the rows where the substance name is 'Animal dander'.
* We use DISTINCT to remove duplicates, if any.
* We select only the relevant columns: id, date, and description from the encounters table.",3.2168149948120117

Here's the answer:

[SQL]: SELECT SUM(s.quantity) FROM supplies s WHERE s.name='Alcohol disinfectant';

Explanation:

* The question asks for the quantity of the supply named ""Alcohol disinfectant"".
* Since we're looking for a specific supply, we can query the ""supplies"" table directly.
* We use the ""SUM"" aggregation function to get the total quantity of the supply.
* We filter the results using the ""WHERE"" clause to only consider the supply with the name ""Alcohol disinfectant"".

Note: If the quantity column is not numeric, you might need to use a different aggregation function or casting. Also, if there are multiple supplies with the same name, this query will sum up their quantities. If you want to get the quantity of each supply separately, you might need to use a different approach.",4.056486368179321
What kind of allergy has the code 5640?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[SQL]: SELECT description FROM allergies WHERE code=5640;

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the type of allergy with the code 5640, so we only need to query the ""allergies"" table.
* We're interested in the ""description"" column, which is the type of allergy, so we select only that column.
* We use the ""WHERE"" clause to filter the results to only include the row with the code 5640.

Note: Assuming the ""allergies"" table has columns ""code"" and ""description"", and the ""code"" column is the primary key or has a unique constraint. If the table structure is different, the query might need to be adjusted accordingly.",4.976512432098389
Can you give me the SNOMED code for the allergy with the description Mold (organism)?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the given question.

[Q]: 'Can you give me the SNOMED code for the allergy with the description Mold (organism)?'

To answer this question, I'll assume there are two tables: `allergies` and `codes`. The `allergies` table has columns `id`, `description`, and `code_id`, and the `codes` table has columns `id` and `snomed_code`.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT c.snomed_code FROM allergies a JOIN codes c ON a.code_id = c.id WHERE a.description = 'Mold (organism)';

This query joins the `allergies` table with the `codes` table on the `code_id` foreign key, and then selects the `snomed_code` column from the `codes` table where the `description` column in the `allergies` table matches 'Mold (organism)'.",6.08536958694458

Here's the explanation:

* We need to count the number of encounters covered by the payer with the ID 0133f751-9229-3cfd-815f-b6d4979bdd6a.
* We start with the `encounters` table, as we're interested in counting encounters.
* We join the `claims` table on the `claimid` foreign key, as claims are related to encounters.
* We then join the `payers` table on the `payerid` foreign key, as payers are related to claims.
* We filter the results to only include the payer with the specified ID using the `WHERE` clause.
* Finally, we use `COUNT(DISTINCT e.id)` to count the number of unique encounters covered by the payer.",5.669897794723511

[Q]: 'Who has been treated with the procedure Assessment of substance use (procedure)?'

To answer this question, we need to join the `procedures` table with the `patients` table through the `encounters` table, as a patient can have multiple encounters, and each encounter can have multiple procedures.

Assuming the table structures are as follows:

* `patients` table: `id`, `first`, `last`
* `encounters` table: `id`, `patientid` (foreign key referencing `patients.id`), `procedureid` (foreign key referencing `procedures.id`)

[Q]: 'What is the name of the supply with the code 706226000?'

[SQL]: SELECT s.name FROM supplies s WHERE s.code='706226000';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the name of the supply with a specific code, so we only need to query the `supplies` table.
* We use the `WHERE` clause to filter the results based on the provided code.
* Since we only need the name of the supply, we only select the `name` column.

Note: Assuming the `code` column is unique in the `supplies` table, we don't need to use `DISTINCT` in this case. If the `code` column is not unique, and you want to retrieve all supply names with the same code, you can use `DISTINCT` to remove duplicates.",5.03155255317688

What is the base cost of the medication with the code 855332?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[SQL]: SELECT m.base_cost FROM medications m WHERE m.code='855332';

Here's a brief explanation of the query:

* We only need to query the `medications` table since the question only mentions the medication code.
* We select the `base_cost` column, which is the relevant column to answer the question.
* We use a simple `WHERE` clause to filter the results to only include the medication with the code `855332`.

Note that if the `code` column is not unique in the `medications` table, we might need to use `DISTINCT` or `GROUP BY` to handle duplicate values. However, based on the provided information, it seems that the `code` column is unique, so a simple `WHERE` clause suffices.",5.013638257980347

* We only select the `address` column, as it's the only relevant information required to answer the question.",4.180294752120972
Please provide me the number of immunizations covered by the payer with the ID e03e23c9-4df1-3eb6-a62d-f70f02301496.,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the given question.

[Q]: 'Please provide me the number of immunizations covered by the payer with the ID e03e23c9-4df1-3eb6-a62d-f70f02301496.'

To answer this question, I'll assume there are three tables: `payers`, `coverage`, and `immunizations`. The `payers` table has a column `id` with the payer's ID, the `coverage` table has columns `payerid` (foreign key referencing `payers.id`) and `immunizationid` (foreign key referencing `immunizations.id`), and the `immunizations` table has a column `id`.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: 
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT i.id) 
FROM payers p 
JOIN coverage c ON p.id = c.payerid 
JOIN immunizations i ON c.immunizationid = i.id 
WHERE p.id = 'e03e23c9-4df1-3eb6-a62d-f70f02301496';

This query joins the `payers`, `coverage`, and `immunizations` tables using their respective foreign keys, filters the results to only include the payer with the specified ID, and then counts the distinct number of immunizations covered by that payer.",5.32825493812561
What is the successrate of medication Simvastatin 10 MG Oral Tablet?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

Assuming we have the following tables:

* `medications` with columns `id`, `name`, and `dosage`
* `treatments` with columns `id`, `medicationid`, `patientid`, and `outcome` (where `outcome` can be 'success' or 'failure')
* `patients` with columns `id`, `first`, and `last`

Here's the SQL query to answer the question:

```
[SQL]: SELECT 
       (SUM(CASE WHEN t.outcome = 'success' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*)) * 100 AS success_rate
FROM 
       treatments t 
JOIN 
       medications m ON t.medicationid = m.id 
WHERE 
       m.name = 'Simvastatin 10 MG Oral Tablet';
```

This query joins the `treatments` table with the `medications` table on the `medicationid` foreign key. It then filters the results to only include rows where the medication name is 'Simvastatin 10 MG Oral Tablet'. The success rate is calculated by counting the number of successful outcomes and dividing it by the total number of treatments, multiplied by 100 to convert to a percentage.",6.260731935501099

[SQL]: SELECT s.quality FROM supplies s WHERE s.code='1137596000';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the quality of the supply with a specific code, so we only need to query the `supplies` table.
* We use the `WHERE` clause to filter the results to only include the supply with the code `1137596000`.
* Since we're only interested in the quality of the supply, we only select the `quality` column from the `supplies` table.

Note: If the `code` column is not unique in the `supplies` table, we might need to use `SELECT DISTINCT` to remove duplicates, but based on the provided information, it's not necessary in this case.",6.0025413036346436

FROM allergies a 
JOIN patients p ON a.patientid = p.id 
JOIN substances s ON a.substanceid = s.id 
WHERE s.name = 'Grass pollen';

Here's the explanation:

* We need to join three tables: allergies, patients, and substances.
* The allergies table is joined with patients on the patientid foreign key.
* The allergies table is also joined with substances on the substanceid foreign key.
* We filter the results to only include the patient who has an allergy with the substance name 'Grass pollen'.
* We use DISTINCT to remove duplicates and only retrieve unique patient names.

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT is.body_site_code FROM imaging_studies is WHERE is.id='83028cf1-659e-8f10-d801-153a5fdd11f3';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the body site code of the imaging study with a specific ID.
* Since the question only mentions the imaging study ID, we don't need to join any other tables.
* We use the `DISTINCT` keyword to ensure we get a unique result, even if there are multiple rows with the same body site code (although it's unlikely in this case).
* We select only the `body_site_code` column, as it's the only relevant column mentioned in the question.

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT is.sop_code FROM imaging_studies is WHERE is.id='fcbd803f-8ac1-a6fb-1ea8-aa71925db967';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the SOP code of the imaging study with a specific ID.
* Since the question only mentions the imaging study, we only need to query the `imaging_studies` table.
* We use the `WHERE` clause to filter the results based on the provided ID.
* We use `SELECT DISTINCT` to ensure we get a unique SOP code, in case there are duplicate entries (although unlikely in this case).

Note: Assuming the `imaging_studies` table has an `id` column and an `sop_code` column. If the column names are different, please adjust the query accordingly.",5.20499324798584

Here's the SQL query:

```
SELECT i.date 
FROM immunizations i 
JOIN vaccines v ON i.vaccine_id = v.id 
WHERE v.name = 'Hep B adult';
```

This query joins the `immunizations` table with the `vaccines` table on the `vaccine_id` column, and then selects the `date` column where the `name` column in the `vaccines` table is 'Hep B adult'.",5.978579044342041
Can you tell me the birthdate of the patient named Omega729 Lind531?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[SQL]: SELECT p.birthdate FROM patients p WHERE p.first='Omega729' AND p.last='Lind531';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the birthdate of a specific patient, so we only need to query the `patients` table.
* We use the `WHERE` clause to filter the results based on the patient's first and last names, which are 'Omega729' and 'Lind531', respectively.
* Since we're only interested in the birthdate, we only select the `birthdate` column from the `patients` table.",4.860202312469482
What is the base cost of the medication with the code 308136?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'What is the base cost of the medication with the code 308136?'

To answer this question, I assume there are two tables: `medications` and `prices`. The `medications` table has columns `code` and `id`, and the `prices` table has columns `medicationid` (foreign key referencing `id` in `medications`) and `base_cost`.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT p.base_cost FROM medications m JOIN prices p ON m.id = p.medicationid WHERE m.code = 308136;

This query joins the `medications` and `prices` tables on the `medicationid` foreign key, and then filters the results to only include the medication with the code 308136. The `SELECT` statement only retrieves the `base_cost` column, which is the relevant information requested in the question.",5.049878835678101
Please provide me reasons for performing the procedure Depression screening (procedure).,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT r.reason FROM procedures p 
JOIN reasons r ON p.id = r.procedureid 
WHERE p.name='Depression screening';

Explanation:

* We need to query the `procedures` table to find the procedure with the name 'Depression screening'.
* We then join the `reasons` table with the `procedures` table on the `procedureid` foreign key.
* Finally, we select the distinct `reason` column from the `reasons` table.

Note: Assuming the `procedures` table has a column `name` and the `reasons` table has a column `reason` and a foreign key `procedureid` referencing the `id` column in the `procedures` table. If the schema is different, the query may need to be adjusted accordingly.",5.004195928573608
Please provide me the number of immunizations uncovered by the payer with the ID 26aab0cd-6aba-3e1b-ac5b-05c8867e762c.,"Based on the provided question, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query. Here's the answer:

JOIN payers p ON cl.payerid = p.id 
WHERE p.id='26aab0cd-6aba-3e1b-ac5b-05c8867e762c';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the number of immunizations uncovered by the payer with a specific ID.
* We need to join three tables: immunizations, claims, and payers.
* The join between immunizations and claims is based on the claimid foreign key.
* The join between claims and payers is based on the payerid foreign key.
* We use the COUNT(DISTINCT i.id) to get the number of unique immunizations.
* We filter the results using the WHERE clause to only consider the payer with the specified ID.",6.080899953842163
Which patient ID is associated with the imaging study with series UID 1.2.840.99999999.1.27045513.1683721997276?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the given question.

How quickly does amLODIPine 2.5 MG Oral Tablet start to work?,"Based on the provided question, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query. However, I need to make some assumptions about the database schema and tables involved.

Assuming there are two tables: `medications` and `effects`. The `medications` table has columns `id`, `name`, and `dosage`, and the `effects` table has columns `id`, `medication_id` (foreign key referencing `medications.id`), `onset_time`, and `description`.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT e.onset_time FROM medications m JOIN effects e ON m.id = e.medication_id WHERE m.name = 'amLODIPine 2.5 MG Oral Tablet';

This query joins the `medications` table with the `effects` table on the `medication_id` foreign key, and then filters the results to only include the row where the medication name matches 'amLODIPine 2.5 MG Oral Tablet'. The `onset_time` column is selected, which should provide the answer to the question.

Please note that this query assumes the existence of the mentioned tables and columns. If the actual database schema is different, the query may need to be adjusted accordingly.",5.196316480636597
Could you provide information about the ethnicity of the patient named Lynwood354 Kuphal363?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[SQL]: SELECT e.ethnicity FROM patients p LEFT JOIN ethnicity e ON p.ethnicityid = e.id WHERE p.first='Lynwood354' AND p.last='Kuphal363';

Here's how I constructed the query:

* I assumed that the patient's name is stored in the `patients` table with columns `first` and `last`.
* I assumed that the ethnicity information is stored in a separate table called `ethnicity` with a column `ethnicity`.
* I used the foreign key `ethnicityid` in the `patients` table to join with the `id` column in the `ethnicity` table.
* I filtered the results to only include the patient with the name 'Lynwood354 Kuphal363' using the `WHERE` clause.
* I only selected the `ethnicity` column from the `ethnicity` table, as that's the information requested in the question.",7.583434104919434
Please provide me the encounters that are related to the medication with the code 314076.,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

Here's the answer:

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT e.* FROM medications m 
JOIN medication_encounters me ON m.id = me.medicationid 
JOIN encounters e ON me.encounterid = e.id 
WHERE m.code = '314076';

Explanation:

* We need to find the encounters related to the medication with the code 314076.
* We start by selecting the columns from the `encounters` table (using `e.*` to select all columns).
* We join the `medications` table with the `medication_encounters` table on the `medicationid` foreign key.
* We then join the `medication_encounters` table with the `encounters` table on the `encounterid` foreign key.
* Finally, we filter the results using the `WHERE` clause to only include rows where the `code` column in the `medications` table is '314076'.

Note: I assume that the `medications` table has a column named `code`, and the `medication_encounters` table has foreign keys `medicationid` and `encounterid` that link to the `id` columns in the `medications` and `encounters` tables, respectively. If the schema is different, the query may need to be adjusted accordingly.",4.331607341766357
Do you have the name of the patient corresponding to the ID 77df276b-9d94-daea-fcf4-04b30c370fc7?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'Do you have the name of the patient corresponding to the ID 77df276b-9d94-daea-fcf4-04b30c370fc7?'

[SQL]: SELECT p.first, p.last FROM patients p WHERE p.id='77df276b-9d94-daea-fcf4-04b30c370fc7';

This query directly queries the `patients` table, as the question only asks for the patient's name corresponding to a specific ID. It selects the `first` and `last` columns, which are likely the patient's first and last names, respectively. The `WHERE` clause filters the results to only include the patient with the specified ID.",6.400309801101685

WHERE p.id = '734afbd6-4794-363b-9bc0-6a3981533ed5' AND cl.covered = FALSE;

Here's the explanation:

* We need to count the number of immunizations that are not covered by the payer with the specified ID.
* We join the `immunizations` table with the `claims` table on the `claimid` foreign key.
* We then join the `claims` table with the `payers` table on the `payerid` foreign key.
* We filter the results to only include the payer with the specified ID and claims that are not covered (`cl.covered = FALSE`).
* Finally, we use `COUNT(DISTINCT i.id)` to count the number of unique immunizations that meet the conditions.",5.202006101608276

To answer this question, I'll assume there are two tables: `immunizations` and `patients`. The `immunizations` table has columns `id`, `patientid`, and `code`, and the `patients` table has columns `id`, `first`, and `last`. The `patientid` column in the `immunizations` table is a foreign key referencing the `id` column in the `patients` table.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT p.first, p.last FROM immunizations i LEFT JOIN patients p ON i.patientid = p.id WHERE i.code = 121;

This query joins the `immunizations` table with the `patients` table on the `patientid` column, and then filters the results to only include rows where the `code` column in the `immunizations` table is 121. The `SELECT DISTINCT` clause ensures that we only get unique patient names.",5.5733911991119385

WHERE p.id = 'b046940f-1664-3047-bca7-dfa76be352a4' AND m.covered = FALSE;

Here's the explanation:

* We need to count the number of medications that are uncovered by the payer with the ID `b046940f-1664-3047-bca7-dfa76be352a4`.
* We join the `medications` table with the `claims` table on the `claimid` foreign key.
* We join the `claims` table with the `payers` table on the `payerid` foreign key.
* We filter the results to only include the payer with the specified ID and medications that are not covered (`m.covered = FALSE`).
* We use `COUNT(DISTINCT m.id)` to count the number of unique medications that meet the conditions.",5.369384288787842
How many procedures are covered by the payer Anthem?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[SQL]: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT p.id) 
FROM procedures p 
JOIN payers py ON p.payerid = py.id 
WHERE py.name = 'Anthem';

Here's a brief explanation of the query:

* We're counting the number of distinct procedure IDs (`p.id`) that are covered by the payer 'Anthem'.
* We're joining the `procedures` table with the `payers` table on the `payerid` foreign key.
* We're filtering the results to only include procedures where the payer's name is 'Anthem'.

Note: Assuming the `procedures` table has a column `payerid` that references the `id` column in the `payers` table, and the `payers` table has a column `name` that stores the payer's name. If the schema is different, the query may need to be adjusted accordingly.",5.054822683334351
What is the quality of the supply with the code 337388004?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[SQL]: SELECT s.quality FROM supplies s WHERE s.code='337388004';

Here's my reasoning:

* The question asks about the quality of a specific supply with a given code.
* Since the question only mentions the supply code, I assume there is a table called ""supplies"" with a column ""code"" that matches the given code.
* The question asks for the quality of the supply, so I select the ""quality"" column from the ""supplies"" table.
* I use a simple WHERE clause to filter the results to only include the supply with the code '337388004'.

Note: If the ""supplies"" table has a more complex structure or relationships with other tables, the query might need to be adjusted accordingly. However, based on the provided information, this query should provide the desired result.",5.002539873123169

WHERE c.code = '8867-4';",6.030088663101196
Please provide me reasons for performing the procedure Assessment of anxiety (procedure).,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

Assuming there are three tables: `procedures`, `reasons`, and `procedure_reasons` (a junction table to establish many-to-many relationships between `procedures` and `reasons`).

Here's the SQL query:

```
SELECT DISTINCT r.reason 
FROM procedures p 
JOIN procedure_reasons pr ON p.id = pr.procedureid 
JOIN reasons r ON pr.reasonid = r.id 
WHERE p.name = 'Assessment of anxiety';
```

This query joins the `procedures` table with the `procedure_reasons` junction table on the `procedureid` foreign key, and then joins the `reasons` table on the `reasonid` foreign key. It filters the results to only include the reasons associated with the 'Assessment of anxiety' procedure. The `DISTINCT` keyword is used to remove duplicate reasons.",4.018383979797363
Please provide me the patients with the allergy Mold (organism).,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'Please provide me the patients with the allergy Mold (organism).'
[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT p.first, p.last 
FROM allergies a 
JOIN patients p ON a.patientid = p.id 
JOIN allergens al ON a.allergenid = al.id 
WHERE al.name = 'Mold (organism)';

Here's the explanation:

* We need to join three tables: allergies, patients, and allergens.
* The allergies table is joined with patients on the patientid foreign key.
* The allergies table is also joined with allergens on the allergenid foreign key.
* We filter the results to only include patients with the allergy 'Mold (organism)' by specifying the condition in the WHERE clause.
* We use DISTINCT to remove duplicate patient names, and only select the first and last names of the patients.",5.070072174072266
Give me the base cost of the immunization HPV  quadrivalent.,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[SQL]: SELECT base_cost FROM immunizations WHERE name='HPV quadrivalent';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the base cost of a specific immunization, which is 'HPV quadrivalent'.
* Since the question only mentions the immunization name, we can assume that the relevant table is 'immunizations'.
* We only need to query the 'base_cost' column, as per the question.
* We use the 'WHERE' clause to filter the results based on the immunization name.

Note: If the immunization name is not unique, we might need to use the 'DISTINCT' keyword to remove duplicates. However, in this case, it's not necessary as the question implies a specific immunization.",4.947728395462036
Please provide me the encounters that are related to the observation with the code 785-6.,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the given question.

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT e.* 
FROM observations o 
JOIN encounters e ON o.encounterid = e.id 
WHERE o.code = '785-6';

Here's a brief explanation of the query:

* We start by selecting the columns from the `encounters` table (represented by `e.*`) since the question asks for the encounters related to the observation with the code '785-6'.
* We join the `observations` table (`o`) with the `encounters` table (`e`) on the `encounterid` column, which is the foreign key that links an observation to an encounter.
* We filter the results using the `WHERE` clause to only include observations with the code '785-6'.

Note that I'm assuming the existence of the `encounterid` column in the `observations` table and the `id` column in the `encounters` table, which serve as the foreign key and primary key, respectively, for the join operation. If the actual column names differ, the query would need to be adjusted accordingly.",6.179203748703003

Explanation:

* The question asks for the SOP code and description of the imaging study with a specific ID.
* Since the question only mentions the imaging study, we only need to query the `imaging_studies` table.
* We use the `WHERE` clause to filter the results based on the provided ID.
* We use `SELECT DISTINCT` to ensure we get unique results, although in this case, it's unlikely to have duplicate SOP codes and descriptions for the same imaging study ID.",5.237302780151367

FROM members m 
JOIN payers p ON m.payerid = p.id 
WHERE p.id = 'd31fccc3-1767-390d-966a-22a5156f4219';

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks for the total number of months a payer with a specific ID has been a member.
* We need to join the `members` table with the `payers` table using the `payerid` foreign key.
* We use the `DATEDIFF` function to calculate the difference between the current date and the `startdate` of the member.
* Since we want the result in months, we divide the result by 30.
* We use the `SUM` aggregation function to get the total number of months.
* Finally, we filter the result to only include the payer with the specified ID.",4.096097707748413
When was the care plan Diabetes self management plan used?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'When was the care plan Diabetes self management plan used?'

To answer this question, I'll assume there are two tables: `care_plans` and `care_plan_usages`. The `care_plans` table has columns `id`, `name`, and the `care_plan_usages` table has columns `id`, `care_plan_id`, and `used_at`.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT cpu.used_at FROM care_plans cp INNER JOIN care_plan_usages cpu ON cp.id = cpu.care_plan_id WHERE cp.name = 'Diabetes self management plan';

This query joins the `care_plans` table with the `care_plan_usages` table on the `care_plan_id` foreign key. It then selects the `used_at` column from the `care_plan_usages` table where the `name` column in the `care_plans` table is 'Diabetes self management plan'. The `DISTINCT` keyword is used to remove duplicate `used_at` values.",6.13624382019043

To answer this question, I'll assume there are three tables: `patients`, `organizations`, and `patient_organizations` (a junction table to link patients with organizations).

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: 
SELECT DISTINCT p.first, p.last 
FROM patient_organizations po 
JOIN patients p ON po.patient_id = p.id 
JOIN organizations o ON po.organization_id = o.id 
WHERE o.id = '36d328a2-68bb-3967-a9bf-00897a7c945f';

This query joins the `patient_organizations` table with both `patients` and `organizations` tables using their respective foreign keys. It then filters the results to only include patients linked with the organization having the specified ID. The `DISTINCT` keyword ensures that duplicate patient names are not returned.",6.176449775695801

Which patients have the observation Respiratory rate?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'Which patients have the observation Respiratory rate?'

To answer this question, we need to join the `patients` table with the `observations` table, as the observation ""Respiratory rate"" is likely stored in the `observations` table, and we want to retrieve the patient information.

Assuming the `observations` table has a column `name` to store the observation name, and a foreign key `patientid` referencing the `id` column in the `patients` table, the correct SQL query would be:

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT p.first, p.last FROM observations o INNER JOIN patients p ON o.patientid = p.id WHERE o.name = 'Respiratory rate';

This query joins the `observations` table with the `patients` table on the `patientid` column, filters the results to only include observations with the name ""Respiratory rate"", and returns the distinct first and last names of the patients who have this observation.",6.281102657318115

[Q]: 'What kind of allergy is described as Allergy to substance (finding)?'

To answer this question, I'll assume there are two tables: `allergies` and `findings`. The `allergies` table has columns `id`, `description`, and `finding_id`, and the `findings` table has columns `id` and `name`.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT a.description FROM allergies a JOIN findings f ON a.finding_id = f.id WHERE f.name = 'Allergy to substance';

This query joins the `allergies` table with the `findings` table on the `finding_id` foreign key, and then selects the `description` column from the `allergies` table where the `name` column in the `findings` table is 'Allergy to substance'.",4.048370361328125

What is the reason for performing the procedure with the code 428211000124100?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'What is the reason for performing the procedure with the code 428211000124100?'

To answer this question, I'll assume there are two tables: `procedures` and `procedure_reasons`. The `procedures` table has columns `id`, `code`, and `procedure_reason_id`, and the `procedure_reasons` table has columns `id` and `reason`.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT pr.reason FROM procedures p INNER JOIN procedure_reasons pr ON p.procedure_reason_id = pr.id WHERE p.code = '428211000124100';

This query joins the `procedures` table with the `procedure_reasons` table on the `procedure_reason_id` foreign key, and then selects the `reason` column from the `procedure_reasons` table where the `code` column in the `procedures` table matches the given procedure code.",7.891797065734863
Please provide me the encounters which are related to the observation Body mass index (BMI) [Percentile] Per age and sex.,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the given question.

Here's the query:

```
SELECT DISTINCT e.id, e.date, e.description 
FROM encounters e 
JOIN observations o ON e.id = o.encounterid 
JOIN observation_codes oc ON o.observationcodeid = oc.id 
WHERE oc.code = 'Body mass index (BMI) [Percentile] Per age and sex';
```

Here's how I arrived at this query:

* The question asks for encounters related to a specific observation, so we need to join the `encounters` table with the `observations` table using the `encounterid` foreign key.
* We also need to join the `observations` table with the `observation_codes` table using the `observationcodeid` foreign key to filter by the specific observation code.
* The `WHERE` clause filters the results to only include encounters related to the 'Body mass index (BMI) [Percentile] Per age and sex' observation code.
* The `SELECT` statement only includes the relevant columns from the `encounters` table, which are `id`, `date`, and `description`.

Note that I assumed the existence of the following tables and columns:

* `encounters` table with columns `id`, `date`, and `description`
* `observations` table with columns `id`, `encounterid`, and `observationcodeid`
* `observation_codes` table with columns `id` and `code`

If these assumptions are incorrect, please provide more information about the database schema, and I'll be happy to adjust the query accordingly.",4.617402076721191

[Q]: 'Please provide me the body site description of the imaging study with the ID d3fa7d2e-1bca-65f1-74ae-d326343ab849.'

To answer this question, I'll assume there are two tables: `imaging_studies` and `body_sites`. The `imaging_studies` table has a foreign key `body_site_id` that references the `id` column in the `body_sites` table.

[SQL]: 
SELECT bs.description 
FROM imaging_studies is 
JOIN body_sites bs ON is.body_site_id = bs.id 
WHERE is.id = 'd3fa7d2e-1bca-65f1-74ae-d326343ab849';

This query joins the `imaging_studies` table with the `body_sites` table on the `body_site_id` foreign key, and then selects the `description` column from the `body_sites` table where the `id` column in the `imaging_studies` table matches the given ID.",5.171459913253784
How many employees have received promotions or transfers within the company?,"Based on the provided question, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query. Since the question doesn't explicitly mention the database values, I'll make some assumptions about the table and column names.

Let's assume we have two tables: `employees` and `employment_history`. The `employees` table has columns `id`, `first`, and `last`, while the `employment_history` table has columns `id`, `employee_id`, `event_type` (which can be either 'promotion' or 'transfer'), and `event_date`.

Here's the SQL query:

Please provide me the patients with the condition Acute viral pharyngitis (disorder).,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'Please provide me the patients with the condition Acute viral pharyngitis (disorder).'

To answer this question, I'll assume there are three tables: `patients`, `conditions`, and `patient_conditions`. The `patient_conditions` table is a junction table that connects patients with conditions.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: 
SELECT DISTINCT p.first, p.last 
FROM patients p 
LEFT JOIN patient_conditions pc ON p.id = pc.patientid 
LEFT JOIN conditions c ON pc.conditionid = c.id 
WHERE c.name = 'Acute viral pharyngitis (disorder)';

This query joins the `patients` table with the `patient_conditions` table on the `patientid` column, and then joins the result with the `conditions` table on the `conditionid` column. The `WHERE` clause filters the results to only include patients with the condition 'Acute viral pharyngitis (disorder)'.

Which ethnicity does patient Rick943 have?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'Which ethnicity does patient Rick943 have?'

To answer this question, we need to query the patients table and the demographics table, as the ethnicity information is likely stored in the demographics table.

Assuming the patients table has columns 'id', 'username', and the demographics table has columns 'patientid', 'ethnicity', we can write the following SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT d.ethnicity FROM patients p LEFT JOIN demographics d ON p.id = d.patientid WHERE p.username = 'Rick943';

This query joins the patients table with the demographics table on the patientid foreign key, and then filters the result to only include the row where the patient's username is 'Rick943'. The SELECT statement only retrieves the ethnicity column, which is the relevant information needed to answer the question.",6.537180662155151

[Q]: 'Please provide me the name of the provider associated with the encounter 6f9eee55-299f-91fd-9363-1507a40f1a2b.'

To answer this question, I'll assume there are three tables: `encounters`, `providers`, and `encounter_providers` (a junction table to establish the many-to-many relationship between encounters and providers).

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: 
SELECT DISTINCT pr.first, pr.last 
FROM encounters e 
JOIN encounter_providers ep ON e.id = ep.encounterid 
JOIN providers pr ON ep.providerid = pr.id 
WHERE e.id = '6f9eee55-299f-91fd-9363-1507a40f1a2b';

This query joins the `encounters` table with the `encounter_providers` table on the `encounterid` foreign key, and then joins the result with the `providers` table on the `providerid` foreign key. The `WHERE` clause filters the result to only include the encounter with the specified ID. The `SELECT` statement retrieves the `first` and `last` names of the associated provider.",4.231239080429077

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT o.observation_date FROM observations o LEFT JOIN codes c ON o.code_id = c.id WHERE c.code='72166-2';

Here's a brief explanation of the query:

* We're selecting the `observation_date` column from the `observations` table, which is the relevant column to answer the question.
* We're joining the `observations` table with the `codes` table using the `code_id` foreign key, as the question mentions a specific code.
* We're filtering the results to only include observations with the code '72166-2' using the `WHERE` clause.
* We're using `DISTINCT` to remove any duplicate observation dates, if any.

Note that this query assumes the existence of the `observations` and `codes` tables, as well as the `code_id` foreign key and the `code` column in the `codes` table. If the table structure is different, the query may need to be adjusted accordingly.",6.104292869567871

[Q]: 'Please provide me the provider associated with the claim transaction f6e13a28-f882-cf33-33c7-3aa1721f3fd8.'

To answer this question, I'll assume there are three tables: `claims`, `providers`, and `claim_transactions`. The `claim_transactions` table has a foreign key `claim_id` referencing the `id` column in the `claims` table, and the `claims` table has a foreign key `provider_id` referencing the `id` column in the `providers` table.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: 
SELECT DISTINCT pr.first, pr.last 
FROM claim_transactions ct 
JOIN claims cl ON ct.claim_id = cl.id 
JOIN providers pr ON cl.provider_id = pr.id 
WHERE ct.id = 'f6e13a28-f882-cf33-33c7-3aa1721f3fd8';

This query joins the `claim_transactions` table with the `claims` table on the `claim_id` column, and then joins the resulting table with the `providers` table on the `provider_id` column. It then selects the distinct `first` and `last` names of the provider associated with the claim transaction having the specified ID.",5.409092664718628

Please provide me the number of immunizations uncovered by the payer Cigna Health.,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

Assuming there are two tables: `immunizations` and `payers`, where `immunizations` has a foreign key `payer_id` referencing the `id` column in the `payers` table.

Here's the SQL query:

```
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT i.id) 
FROM immunizations i 
JOIN payers p ON i.payer_id = p.id 
WHERE p.name = 'Cigna Health';
```

This query joins the `immunizations` table with the `payers` table on the `payer_id` foreign key, and then filters the results to only include immunizations where the payer's name is 'Cigna Health'. The `COUNT(DISTINCT i.id)` function returns the number of unique immunizations uncovered by the payer Cigna Health.",5.005884170532227
Who has been treated with the procedure Depression screening using Patient Health Questionnaire Nine Item score (procedure)?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the given question.

[SQL]: SELECT DISTINCT p.first, p.last 
FROM procedures pr 
JOIN encounters e ON pr.encounterid = e.id 
JOIN patients p ON e.patientid = p.id 
WHERE pr.name = 'Depression screening using Patient Health Questionnaire Nine Item score';

Here's a brief explanation of the query:

* We start by selecting the `first` and `last` columns from the `patients` table, as we want to know the names of the patients who have undergone the specified procedure.
* We join the `procedures` table with the `encounters` table on the `encounterid` foreign key, as a procedure is likely to be associated with an encounter.
* We then join the `encounters` table with the `patients` table on the `patientid` foreign key, as an encounter is associated with a patient.
* Finally, we filter the results to only include procedures with the specified name, 'Depression screening using Patient Health Questionnaire Nine Item score', using the `WHERE` clause.

Note that this query assumes the existence of the necessary tables and foreign keys. If the table structure or relationships are different, the query may need to be adjusted accordingly.",5.667701244354248

To answer this question, we need to join the `patients` table with the `addresses` table, as the state of residence is likely stored in the `addresses` table.

[SQL]: SELECT a.state FROM patients p LEFT JOIN addresses a ON p.id = a.patientid WHERE p.first = 'Oralia106' AND p.last = 'Lockman863';

This query joins the `patients` table with the `addresses` table on the `patientid` foreign key, and then filters the results to only include the patient with the specified first and last names. The `SELECT` statement only retrieves the `state` column from the `addresses` table.",5.119649171829224
What type of observation is Heart rate?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'What type of observation is Heart rate?'

To answer this question, I'll assume there are two tables: `observations` and `observation_types`. The `observations` table has columns `id`, `name`, and `observation_type_id`, and the `observation_types` table has columns `id` and `type`.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT ot.type FROM observations o INNER JOIN observation_types ot ON o.observation_type_id = ot.id WHERE o.name = 'Heart rate';

This query joins the `observations` table with the `observation_types` table on the `observation_type_id` foreign key, and then selects the `type` column from the `observation_types` table where the `name` column in the `observations` table is 'Heart rate'.",5.046454429626465

[Q]: 'Who has been treated with the care plan with the code 736690008?'

To answer this question, we need to join the `patients`, `encounters`, and `care_plans` tables. We'll assume the following table structure:

* `patients` table: `id`, `first`, `last`
* `encounters` table: `id`, `patientid` (foreign key referencing `patients.id`), `careplanid` (foreign key referencing `care_plans.id`)
* `care_plans` table: `id`, `code`

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]: 
SELECT DISTINCT p.first, p.last 
FROM care_plans cp 
JOIN encounters e ON cp.id = e.careplanid 
JOIN patients p ON e.patientid = p.id 
WHERE cp.code = '736690008';

This query joins the `care_plans` table with the `encounters` table on the `careplanid` foreign key, and then joins the `encounters` table with the `patients` table on the `patientid` foreign key. The `WHERE` clause filters the results to only include care plans with the code '736690008'. The `SELECT DISTINCT` statement ensures we get unique patient names.",5.27405047416687

How long does Hydrochlorothiazide 25 MG Oral Tablet effect last?,"Based on the provided notes and examples, I'll create a syntactically correct Postgres SQL query to answer the question.

However, I must point out that the question ""How long does Hydrochlorothiazide 25 MG Oral Tablet effect last?"" cannot be directly answered with a SQL query because the duration of the effect is not a column in any table. It's a piece of information that might be stored in a specific column or table, but it's not explicitly mentioned.

Assuming there's a table called ""medications"" with columns ""name"", ""dosage"", ""form"", and ""effect_duration"", and another table called ""drug_effects"" with columns ""medication_id"" and ""effect_duration"", I can provide a possible SQL query:

[SQL]: SELECT m.name, m.dosage, m.form, de.effect_duration 
FROM medications m 
JOIN drug_effects de ON m.id = de.medication_id 
WHERE m.name = 'Hydrochlorothiazide' AND m.dosage = '25 MG' AND m.form = 'Oral Tablet';

Please note that this query is based on assumptions about the table structure and column names, which might not be accurate. If the actual table structure and column names are different, the query would need to be adjusted accordingly.",5.823489427566528
