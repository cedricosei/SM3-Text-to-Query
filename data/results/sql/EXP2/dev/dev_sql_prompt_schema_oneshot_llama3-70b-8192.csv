This query joins the allergies table with the encounters table and then with the procedures table. It filters the results to only include allergies with the substance 'Tree pollen'. It then groups the results by procedure description and counts the number of occurrences of each procedure. Finally, it orders the results by count in descending order and limits the result to the top 1, which is the most promising procedure.

Note: The assumption is that the substance 'Tree pollen' is stored in the system column of the allergies table. If the substance is stored in a different column, the query would need to be adjusted accordingly.",30.813116788864136

[Q]: 'How many procedures are uncovered by the payer with the ID 734afbd6-4794-363b-9bc0-6a3981533ed5?'

To answer this question, we need to join the `procedures` table with the `encounters` table and then with the `payers` table using the foreign keys. We'll count the number of procedures where the payer's ID matches the given ID and the `BASE_COST` is not covered by the payer.

What is the total number of patients diagnosed with Allergy to substance (finding)?,"Based on the provided schema, I'll create a SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'What is the total number of patients diagnosed with Allergy to substance (finding)?'

To answer this question, we need to query the `allergies` table, which stores information about patient allergies. We'll count the number of unique patients with an allergy code related to ""Allergy to substance (finding)"".

[SQL]:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT a.patient)

If the code value is not known, it would be necessary to provide more information about the code system used in the `allergies` table.

If you want to get the actual patient information (e.g., first name, last name) instead of just counting the number of patients, you can modify the query as follows:

[SQL]:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT p.first, p.last 
FROM allergies a 
JOIN patients p ON a.patient = p.id 
WHERE a.code = <code_for_Allergy_to_substance_finding>;

However, the schema provided does not have a clear indication of what constitutes a successful outcome. Therefore, I will provide a query that retrieves the total number of patients who took the medication, and you can modify it according to your definition of a successful outcome.

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT m.patient) AS total_patients
FROM medications m
WHERE m.code = <code_for_24_HR_Metformin_hydrochloride_500_MG_Extended_Release_Oral_Tablet>;

If you have a column in the `medications` table or another table that indicates the outcome of the medication, you can modify the query to calculate the success rate. For example, if there is a column `outcome` in the `medications` table with values 'successful' or 'unsuccessful', you can use the following query:

```sql
SELECT 
    COUNT(CASE WHEN m.outcome = 'successful' THEN 1 ELSE NULL END) AS successful_patients,
    COUNT(*) AS total_patients,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN m.outcome = 'successful' THEN 1 ELSE NULL END) / COUNT(*) AS success_rate
FROM medications m

What procedures did the patient named Claris36 Bogisich202 undergo?,"Based on the provided schema and notes, I'll create a SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'What procedures did the patient named Claris36 Bogisich202 undergo?'

To answer this question, we need to join the `patients`, `encounters`, and `procedures` tables. We'll use the `patients` table to find the patient with the name 'Claris36 Bogisich202', then join the `encounters` table to find the encounters related to this patient, and finally join the `procedures` table to find the procedures performed during these encounters.

Here's the SQL query:

[SQL]:
```sql
SELECT p.first, p.last, pr.description
FROM patients p
JOIN encounters e ON p.id = e.patient
JOIN procedures pr ON e.id = pr.encounter
WHERE p.first = 'Claris36' AND p.last = 'Bogisich202';

Which illness is most common in warmer climates?,"To answer this question, we need to join the `patients` table with the `conditions` table to get the illnesses, and then join the `patients` table with the `organizations` table to get the location information. We can then group the results by the illness and count the number of occurrences. Finally, we can sort the results by the count in descending order to get the most common illness.

Here is the SQL query:

```
SELECT c.description, COUNT(c.description) AS count
FROM patients p
JOIN conditions c ON p.id = c.patient
JOIN organizations o ON p.address = o.address
WHERE o.lat > 30 AND o.lat < 40  -- assuming warmer climates are between 30 and 40 degrees latitude
GROUP BY c.description
ORDER BY count DESC;
```

This query assumes that warmer climates are between 30 and 40 degrees latitude, which may not be accurate. A more accurate approach would be to use a more precise definition of warmer climates, such as using a temperature range or a specific region.

Also, note that this query assumes that the `address` column in the `patients` table matches the `address` column in the `organizations` table, which may not be the case. A more accurate approach would be to use a more precise way of linking patients to locations, such as using a separate `locations` table.

Finally, this query returns the most common illness in warmer climates, but it does not provide any information about the specific locations where these illnesses are most common. If you want to get more detailed information, you may need to modify the query accordingly.",33.41537857055664

What is the most promising procedure for a patient with Mold (organism)?,"To answer this question, we need to find the procedure that is most commonly associated with patients who have a condition related to Mold (organism). We can do this by joining the `conditions` table with the `procedures` table.

Here is the SQL query:

```
SELECT p.description, COUNT(*) as count
FROM conditions c
JOIN encounters e ON c.encounter = e.id
JOIN procedures p ON e.id = p.encounter
WHERE c.description LIKE '%Mold%'
GROUP BY p.description
ORDER BY count DESC

```

This query first joins the `conditions` table with the `encounters` table on the `encounter` column, and then joins the resulting table with the `procedures` table on the `encounter` column. It then filters the results to only include conditions that have a description containing the word ""Mold"". The results are grouped by procedure description and counted, and the procedure with the highest count is returned as the most promising procedure.

Note that this query assumes that the description of the condition contains the word ""Mold"" to identify patients with a condition related to Mold (organism). If the condition description is not reliable, a more specific identification method may be needed.",31.711455821990967

Here's the explanation:

1. We need to find the total claim cost for a specific encounter, so we'll focus on the `claims_transactions` table, which contains the claim amounts.
2. We'll join the `claims` table to link the claim transactions to the claims, and then join the `encounters` table to filter by the specific encounter ID.
3. We use the foreign keys to establish the relationships between the tables: `claims_transactions.claimid` -> `claims.id`, `claims.patientid` -> `encounters.patient`, and `claims.providerid` -> `encounters.provider`.
4. Finally, we filter the results by the specific encounter ID and use the `SUM` aggregation function to calculate the total claim cost.

Here's a brief explanation of the query:

1. We start by selecting the `first` and `last` names of patients from the `patients` table.
2. We join the `observations` table with the `patients` table on the `patient` column, which is a foreign key referencing the `id` column in the `patients` table.
3. We filter the results using the `WHERE` clause, specifying the conditions:
	* `category` = 'Laboratory' (assuming this is the category for the MCHC observation)
	* `code` = 'MCHC' (the specific observation code)
	* `description` = 'Mass/volume by Automated count' (the specific description for the MCHC observation)

What is the most promising procedure for a patient with Allergy to substance (finding)?,"Based on the provided schema and notes, I'll attempt to answer the question.

[Q]: 'What is the most promising procedure for a patient with Allergy to substance (finding)?'

To answer this question, we need to find the procedure that is most commonly associated with patients who have an allergy to a substance. We can do this by joining the `allergies` table with the `procedures` table through the `patients` and `encounters` tables.

Here's the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT p.description, COUNT(*) as count
FROM allergies a
JOIN patients p2 ON a.patient = p2.id
JOIN encounters e ON a.encounter = e.id
JOIN procedures p ON e.id = p.encounter
WHERE a.system = 'substance'
GROUP BY p.description
ORDER BY count DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

This query joins the `allergies` table with the `patients`, `encounters`, and `procedures` tables to find the procedures associated with patients who have an allergy to a substance. It then groups the results by procedure description and counts the number of occurrences. The `ORDER BY` clause sorts the results in descending order by count, and the `LIMIT 1` clause returns the top result, which is the most promising procedure.

Note that this query assumes that the `system` column in the `allergies` table contains the value 'substance' for allergies to substances. If this is not the case, the query may need to be modified accordingly.",30.9708993434906

FROM payer_transitions pt
WHERE pt.PAYER = 'e03e23c9-4df1-3eb6-a62d-f70f02301496';
```

Here's the explanation:

* We need to find the total number of months a payer with ID `e03e23c9-4df1-3eb6-a62d-f70f02301496` has been a member.
* We can find this information in the `payer_transitions` table, which has `START_DATE` and `END_DATE` columns.
* We need to calculate the duration of each membership period by subtracting `START_DATE` from `END_DATE`.
* Since we want the result in months, we'll divide the duration by 30 (assuming a month has approximately 30 days).
* We'll use the `SUM` aggregation function to add up the durations of all membership periods for the specified payer.
* Finally, we'll filter the results to only include the payer with the specified ID using the `WHERE` clause.",32.026010036468506

WHERE p.id = 'e03e23c9-4df1-3eb6-a62d-f70f02301496' AND i.payer_coverage = 0;
```
Explanation:

* We join the `immunizations` table with the `payers` table on the `payer` column, which is a foreign key referencing the `id` column in the `payers` table.
* We filter the results to only include immunizations where the payer ID matches the specified ID (`e03e23c9-4df1-3eb6-a62d-f70f02301496`).
* We also filter the results to only include immunizations where the `payer_coverage` is 0, indicating that the immunization is uncovered by the payer.
* Finally, we use the `COUNT(*)` aggregation function to count the number of immunizations that meet the specified conditions.",31.972750425338745

Which ethnicity does patient Ana972 have?,"Based on the provided schema and notes, I'll create a SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'Which ethnicity does patient Ana972 have?'

To answer this question, we need to query the `patients` table, which contains the ethnicity information. However, the question doesn't provide the patient's ID, only a unique identifier 'Ana972'. We can assume that 'Ana972' is the patient's name or a part of it.

[SQL]: 
```sql
SELECT ethnicity 
FROM patients 
WHERE first || ' ' || last ILIKE '%Ana972%';
```
This query uses the `ILIKE` operator to search for the patient's name (first and last names concatenated with a space in between) containing the string 'Ana972'. The `||` operator is used for string concatenation. The `ILIKE` operator is case-insensitive, so it will match regardless of the case of the patient's name.

Please note that this query assumes that 'Ana972' is a unique identifier for the patient. If there are multiple patients with similar names, this query might return multiple results.",32.02167248725891

What is the successrate of medication NDA020800 0.3 ML Epinephrine 1 MG/ML Auto-Injector?,"To answer this question, we need to find the success rate of the medication NDA020800 0.3 ML Epinephrine 1 MG/ML Auto-Injector. 

However, the schema provided does not have a direct column to measure the success rate of a medication. We can assume that the success rate can be calculated based on the number of successful encounters (e.g., where the medication was effective) versus the total number of encounters where the medication was used.

Here's a possible query to get the success rate:

```sql
WITH medication_encounters AS (
  SELECT m.code, COUNT(DISTINCT e.id) AS total_encounters
  FROM medications m
  JOIN encounters e ON m.encounter = e.id
  WHERE m.code = 'NDA020800 0.3 ML Epinephrine 1 MG/ML Auto-Injector'
  GROUP BY m.code
),
successful_encounters AS (
  SELECT m.code, COUNT(DISTINCT e.id) AS successful_encounters
  FROM medications m
  JOIN encounters e ON m.encounter = e.id
  WHERE m.code = 'NDA020800 0.3 ML Epinephrine 1 MG/ML Auto-Injector'
  AND e.stop IS NOT NULL  -- assuming a successful encounter has a non-null stop timestamp
  GROUP BY m.code
)
SELECT me.code, me.total_encounters, se.successful_encounters,
       ROUND(se.successful_encounters::numeric / me.total_encounters * 100, 2) AS success_rate
FROM medication_encounters me
JOIN successful_encounters se ON me.code = se.code;
```

This query uses two Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to calculate the total number of encounters and the number of successful encounters for the medication. The success rate is then calculated as the ratio of successful encounters to total encounters, multiplied by 100 and rounded to 2 decimal places.

Note that this query assumes that a successful encounter has a non-null stop timestamp. You may need to adjust this assumption based on your specific use case.

Also, please note that this query is based on the assumption that the success rate can be calculated based on the number of successful encounters. If there's a more accurate way to measure success rate in your system, you should use that instead.",31.625320196151733

What is the most promising procedure for a patient with Allergy to substance (finding)?,"Based on the provided schema and notes, I'll attempt to answer the question.

[Q]: 'What is the most promising procedure for a patient with Allergy to substance (finding)?'

To answer this question, we need to find the procedure that is most commonly associated with patients who have an allergy to a substance. We can do this by joining the `allergies` table with the `procedures` table through the `patients` and `encounters` tables.

Here's the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT p.description, COUNT(*) as count
FROM allergies a
JOIN patients p2 ON a.patient = p2.id
JOIN encounters e ON a.encounter = e.id
JOIN procedures p ON e.id = p.encounter
WHERE a.system = 'substance'
GROUP BY p.description
ORDER BY count DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

This query joins the `allergies` table with the `patients`, `encounters`, and `procedures` tables to find the procedures associated with patients who have an allergy to a substance. It then groups the results by procedure description and counts the number of occurrences. The `ORDER BY` clause sorts the results in descending order by count, and the `LIMIT 1` clause returns the top result, which is the most promising procedure.

Note that this query assumes that the `system` column in the `allergies` table contains the value 'substance' for allergies to substances. If this is not the case, the query may need to be modified accordingly.",31.28006410598755

To answer this question, we need to join the `patients` table with the `payer_transitions` table, as the healthcare coverage status is not directly available in the `patients` table.

[SQL]:
```sql

Which illness is most common in warmer climates?,"To answer this question, we need to join the `patients` table with the `conditions` table to get the illnesses, and then join the `patients` table with the `organizations` table to get the location information. We can then group the results by the illness and count the number of occurrences. Finally, we can sort the results by the count in descending order to get the most common illness.

Here is the SQL query:

```
SELECT c.description, COUNT(c.description) AS count
FROM patients p
JOIN conditions c ON p.id = c.patient
JOIN organizations o ON p.address = o.address
WHERE o.lat > 30 AND o.lat < 40  -- assuming warmer climates are between 30 and 40 degrees latitude
GROUP BY c.description
ORDER BY count DESC;
```

This query assumes that warmer climates are between 30 and 40 degrees latitude, which may not be accurate. A more accurate approach would be to use a more precise definition of warmer climates, such as using a temperature range or a specific region.

Also, note that this query assumes that the `address` column in the `patients` table matches the `address` column in the `organizations` table, which may not be the case. A more accurate approach would be to use a more precise way of linking patients to locations, such as using a separate `locations` table.

Finally, this query returns the most common illness in warmer climates, but it does not provide any information about the specific locations where these illnesses are most common. If you want to get more detailed information, you may need to modify the query accordingly.",32.57784366607666

To answer this question, we need to find the patients who have a condition with the description 'Medication review due (situation)'. We can achieve this by joining the `conditions` table with the `patients` table.

[SQL]:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT p.first, p.last 
FROM conditions c 
JOIN patients p ON c.patient = p.id 
WHERE c.description = 'Medication review due (situation)';
```
This query joins the `conditions` table with the `patients` table on the `patient` column, and then filters the results to only include patients who have a condition with the description 'Medication review due (situation)'. The `DISTINCT` keyword is used to remove duplicate patient names.",30.871402978897095

How many procedures are uncovered by the payer with the ID d31fccc3-1767-390d-966a-22a5156f4219?,"Based on the provided schema and notes, I'll create a SQL query to answer the question.

[Q]: 'How many procedures are uncovered by the payer with the ID d31fccc3-1767-390d-966a-22a5156f4219?'

[SQL]:
```
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM procedures p
JOIN encounters e ON p.encounter = e.id

WHERE py.id = 'd31fccc3-1767-390d-966a-22a5156f4219' AND p.base_cost > e.payer_coverage;
```
Explanation:

1. We start by selecting the count of procedures that are uncovered by the payer.
2. We join the `procedures` table with the `encounters` table on the `encounter` column, which is a foreign key referencing the `id` column in the `encounters` table.
3. We join the `encounters` table with the `payers` table on the `payer` column, which is a foreign key referencing the `id` column in the `payers` table.
4. We filter the results to only include procedures where the payer ID matches the specified ID (`d31fccc3-1767-390d-966a-22a5156f4219`).
5. We also filter the results to only include procedures where the `base_cost` is greater than the `payer_coverage` in the `encounters` table, indicating that the procedure is uncovered by the payer.

Note: The assumption is that the `base_cost` in the `procedures` table represents the total cost of the procedure, and the `payer_coverage` in the `encounters` table represents the amount covered by the payer. If this assumption is incorrect, the query may need to be adjusted accordingly.",26.665053606033325

To answer this question, we need to join the `patients`, `encounters`, and `procedures` tables. We'll use the `patients` table to filter by the patient's name, the `encounters` table to link the patient to the encounter, and the `procedures` table to get the procedure codes.

[SQL]:

How long does Hydrochlorothiazide 25 MG Oral Tablet effect last?,"Based on the provided schema, I'll try to answer the question.

[Q]: 'How long does Hydrochlorothiazide 25 MG Oral Tablet effect last?'

To answer this question, we need to find the duration of the medication 'Hydrochlorothiazide 25 MG Oral Tablet'. We can find this information in the 'medications' table.

However, the 'medications' table does not have a column that directly stores the duration of the medication's effect. It has 'start' and 'stop' timestamps, but these columns are not specific to the effect duration.

Therefore, I must conclude that:

[SQL]: No answer possible based on given input.

The schema does not provide enough information to answer this question. We would need additional columns or tables that store the effect duration of medications.",30.691646337509155
