            The query should include all necessary prefixes. 
            The defined prefixes are used to shorten long URI links in SPARQL queries and improve the readability of the query. 
            Instead of using the full URI links in the query, you can use the defined prefixes to express the same meaning. For example, snomed: is used as a prefix for https://knacc.umbc.edu/dae-young/kim/ontologies/synthea#snomed:SNOMED-CT to avoid using the full link.

            Please note that the answer should be a syntactically correct SPARQL query. Only query relevant attributes given the question. Be careful not to query for attributes that do not exist. 
            If the question cannot be answered with the given input, please respond with ""No answer possible based on given input"". 
            The defined prefixes are used to shorten long URI links in SPARQL queries and improve the readability of the query. 
            Instead of using the full URI links in the query, you can use the defined prefixes to express the same meaning. For example, snomed: is used as a prefix for https://knacc.umbc.edu/dae-young/kim/ontologies/synthea#snomed:SNOMED-CT to avoid using the full link.

            Please note that the query should be syntactically correct and should only query relevant attributes given the question. Be careful not to query for attributes that do not exist. 
            If the question cannot be answered with the given input, please respond with ""No answer possible based on given input"". 
            Also, please include all necessary prefixes. 
            Finally, use the shortcuts provided instead of the full links.
